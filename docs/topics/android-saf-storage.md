# Android SAF Storage

Topic: `android-saf-storage`

Status: Direct-final-document replacement completed on 2026-08-29 by Tactical
[`191`](../tactical/191-direct-filesystem-storage.md). SAF retains root
authority, lazy acquisition, exact path safety, provider repair, and the shared
40-handle/16-request bounds. Staging documents, provider publication plans,
completion rename, and publication-specific generated facts are removed.
Earlier tactical descriptions below remain historical evidence.

Tactical [`194`](../tactical/194-chromeos-android-extension-control.md)
implements the first multi-root Android product extension of this boundary. It
replaces the
singleton tree URI with a bounded root-ID-to-grant registry, routes the
existing root-tagged broker requests through the exact retained grant, and
lets the shared React presentation invoke Android's SAF picker. One root is
current for new downloads; earlier roots remain for torrents already bound to
them and may be made current explicitly. The existing `tree-uri`/`downloads`
pair migrates in place for RSTorrent users. No locator, descriptor, or payload
path moves into the extension. Physical ChromeOS proves two independent roots,
future-add current/default selection, durable old-torrent binding, referenced
removal rejection, independent grant loss/repair, restart, Compose/React
convergence, and exact cleanup. The companion presentation remains blocked by
its LAN-reachable ChromeOS transport; that does not roll back the in-process
Compose retained-root capability.

Completed Tactical
[`188`](../tactical/188-existing-payload-adoption-and-recheck.md) applies the
shared no-resume discovery/full-check decision to local platform-capability
storage and replaces recursive managed cleanup with an exact payload/empty-
parent plan. Android SAF generated boundaries, provider behavior, builds,
cancellation, and resource bounds passed. Tactical
[`067`](../tactical/067-dynamic-platform-file-acquisition.md) implements
dynamic capability acquisition, one 40-descriptor session pool shared by path
and SAF storage, live Normal/Skip platform support, lazy payload/part
artifacts, and fresh dynamic publication verification. Three product-path API
34 AVD cycles pass with exact hashes and bounded Rust/process descriptor
evidence. The fixed startup manifest remains only in legacy diagnostic proof
APIs and is not an acceptable or used product architecture. A newly
authorized physical run was attempted, but ChromeOS ARCVM ADB was unavailable.
Tactical `073` now makes dynamic publication confirmation a durable
`published`/`checking` handoff; fresh published handles run through the common
piece checker before `complete` can commit.
Completed Tactical
[`143`](../tactical/143-dual-identity-and-persistence-foundation.md) keys SAF
staging, part, publication, descriptor, and removal ownership by opaque
`TorrentId` while preserving the metainfo publication name. Its API-34
schema-18 reset proves the private catalog resets to schema 19 while exact
published and partial SAF sentinel bytes remain untouched and unadopted;
fresh add, restart, recheck, upload, removal, report-once, and resource bounds
pass.
Tactical `081` extends the shared catalog/storage boundary to
libtorrent-scale v1 metainfo: Android consumes compact selection and paged
file catalogs, derives the same deterministic safe operational paths, and
keeps provider requests, documents, and descriptors lazy. It does not add an
Android `.torrent` picker or document-intent intake.
Completed Tactical
[`116`](../tactical/116-platform-storage-coherence-and-ios-feasibility.md)
adds typed platform observations and early root health, reuses the shared
logical published-content owner for SAF upload, converges namespace outcomes,
and isolates fixed descriptor manifests behind a diagnostic-only feature. Its
API 34 AVD and physical Android 17/API 37 matrices pass download, selection,
restart, complete recheck, publication, upload, removal, grant repair,
cancellation, exact cleanup, and bounded-resource assertions. Applicable
Android behavior is now a non-deferrable completion gate for future engine
tacticals.
Completed Tactical
[`120`](../tactical/120-per-torrent-trusting-fast-resume.md) consumes that
common observation seam for the first accepted trusting policy. Supported
local SAF resumes follow the same per-torrent structural decision as path
storage, without requiring an opaque provider token. Matching ordinary resume
trusts only committed bits with zero payload hashing; publication recovery and
explicit or pending Force verification remain full.
Completed Tactical
[`124`](../tactical/124-duplex-verified-piece-upload.md) extends the same
verified/readable authority to incomplete-torrent upload. One API 34
no-window AVD run persists an exact two-piece partial state, fails closed on
grant loss, repairs through the picker, then exchanges complementary Fast
payload with pinned libtorrent through staging and part routes before either
side completes. Rust remains the only payload owner.

Completed Tactical
[`138`](../tactical/138-verified-http-file-serving.md) reuses the same typed
observation and shared-pool contract for verified logical-file reads, including
a fake platform provider that proves exact ranges, representation validation,
and terminal handle release. The generated `MediaFileAvailability` fact
cross-builds for both Android native ABIs, but Android keeps its existing
complete-file `content://` open and intentionally binds no HTTP listener.
Completed Tactical
[`139`](../tactical/139-incomplete-file-streaming-demand.md) reuses the active
logical-range owner and shared platform handle pool for verified incomplete
reads, and cross-builds the demand/scheduler/storage semantics for both
Android native ABIs. The API 34 partial-state profile again fails closed on
grant loss, repairs, exchanges complementary Fast payload, and removes
exactly at 7/40 handles and 2/16 pending requests. Compose still exposes only
completed-file `content://` open; no Android HTTP listener or incomplete-file
presentation is implied.

## Scope

This topic owns the continuing Android Storage Access Framework boundary:

- persisted tree-grant and provider-document ownership;
- dynamic acquisition of seekable file descriptors from safe relative torrent
  identities;
- descriptor lifetime and session-wide resource bounds;
- the division between Android namespace work and Rust payload I/O;
- lazy direct payload, part-file, and restart behavior beneath a SAF
  root; and
- provider failure, cancellation, observability, and validation requirements.

It complements:

- [`download-roots.md`](download-roots.md), which owns user-visible root
  selection, stable root identity, repair, and direct content layout;
- [`client-persistence.md`](client-persistence.md), which owns the durable
  catalog, selected root, file intent, verified state, and restart authority;
- [`storage-throughput-architecture.md`](storage-throughput-architecture.md),
  which owns shared positional I/O, durability epochs, and session/root
  scheduling; and
- [`application-control.md`](application-control.md), which keeps platform
  capabilities and descriptor values out of portable presentation commands.

This topic does not implement desktop-shaped per-add selection among retained
Android roots, cloud document providers, torrent relocation, a general virtual
filesystem, or a second Android storage engine. Tactical `194` adds only the
retained-root policy needed to preserve existing torrent authority when a new
SAF tree becomes current. SAF-backed seeding and bounded file observations are
implemented specifically by Tactical `116`; that evidence does not broaden
the provider claim beyond the tested local SAF path.

## Current State

Tacticals
[`003`](../tactical/003-android-storage-feasibility.md),
[`005`](../tactical/005-saf-selective-storage.md), and
[`009`](../tactical/009-android-saf-session-storage.md) established important
facts that remain in force:

- Android persists a user-selected SAF tree grant and the platform adapter
  owns its URI and provider operations.
- Supported local providers expose `ParcelFileDescriptor` values usable for
  fixed-buffer positional I/O in Rust.
- Rust synchronously duplicates a borrowed descriptor before Kotlin closes
  its `ParcelFileDescriptor`; payload buffers never cross the Kotlin boundary.
- Rust owns torrent-coordinate mapping, verification, selective part storage,
  durability, and direct file state.
- Kotlin owns provider document creation and exact deletion. There is no
  completion rename or provider publication confirmation.
- Grant loss and provider refusal are availability failures, not evidence that
  metadata or verified client state is corrupt.

The product path restores only durable root identity, selection, storage
phase, metadata, and historical verified state. Ordinary eligible resume now
admits that committed bitmap only after exact bounded structural observations;
it does not claim a fresh hash pass. `ApplicationService` owns
one pool whose permits count actual Rust-owned handles, including evicted
handles still retained by immutable jobs. Kotlin resolves one exact document
per cache miss using four bounded provider workers and closes the borrowed PFD
after synchronous Rust duplication. `SelectiveStorage` and `PartFile` keep
logical references rather than retained manifests, so construction and
metadata-only work create no payload or part artifacts.

Tactical [`063`](../tactical/063-live-file-selection.md)'s `Normal`/`Skip`,
boundary routing, lazy-part, retained-destination, materialization, and
restart semantics now apply to platform storage through the same Rust
implementation. Higher and lower priorities remain deliberately absent from
the UI and this boundary.

## Accepted Architecture

### One shared Rust storage implementation

SAF is not a second implementation of selective torrent storage. The following
remain shared Rust behavior for path and Android destinations:

- safe metainfo-relative layout and torrent-coordinate mapping;
- piece picking and file selection;
- immutable positional read, write, and hash plans;
- part-file slot allocation and verified-span materialization;
- routing-generation fences;
- durability checkpoints and conservative recheck; and
- verified direct-content reads for upload and seeding.

The platform-specific difference is intentionally narrow: how a safe logical
file identity becomes one owned, seekable file descriptor, and how namespace
operations such as provider rename or deletion are performed.

Do not introduce an Android filesystem that reimplements piece placement, a
Kotlin payload cache, a native-host socket proxy, or a general-purpose
filesystem trait with operations not required by the proven storage lifecycle.

### Android owns namespace capability; Rust owns open handles

`ProductEngineService` is the current same-process lifecycle owner for
persisted grants and SAF work. Dynamic acquisition extends that owner; it does
not require another Android service, process, or I/O daemon. Tactical `194`
changes its singleton locator lookup to a bounded app-private registry keyed
by the root ID already present on each platform request. The application
database remains authoritative for the current/default root and each
torrent's binding; Android remains authoritative for the corresponding URI
and grant.

The Android adapter must provide a small concrete broker with these semantic
operations:

- open an existing document without creating it;
- open or create a document and its exact parent directories;
- remove an engine-owned document after Rust releases its handle;
- resolve bounded provider observations needed for restart or repair.

The broker receives a stable root ID, torrent/storage identity, trusted role,
validated relative path components, access mode, and request generation. It
does not receive piece payload. Raw SAF URIs and descriptor numbers remain
inside the platform adapter and UniFFI handoff rather than portable commands,
SQLite torrent records, browser views, or remote transports.

On an open request, Kotlin resolves or creates the document through
`DocumentsContract`, opens a `ParcelFileDescriptor` off the Android main
thread, and supplies its borrowed descriptor with the request ID. Rust
duplicates it with close-on-exec before accepting the response. Kotlin then
closes its original; Rust owns and closes the duplicate.

The handoff is asynchronous and cancellation-aware. Exact UniFFI records and
delivery mechanics belong to the implementation tactical, but the boundary
must not invoke a reentrant Kotlin callback while holding an engine, session,
storage, or cache lock. A torrent-generation owner awaits the request, and a
late response to a cancelled or replaced generation is rejected and closed.

### Dynamic acquisition replaces startup manifests

Startup restores only durable root identity, verified metadata, selection,
storage phase, and conservative resume evidence. It never constructs a
descriptor manifest proportional to torrent file count.

An ordinary storage operation follows this sequence:

1. Rust maps the torrent range to a logical payload or auxiliary file.
2. The shared file pool looks up the stable key.
3. A hit returns a shared Rust handle without crossing into Kotlin.
4. A miss is single-flighted per key and access mode.
5. Path storage opens locally; SAF storage asks the Android broker for one
   descriptor.
6. Rust duplicates and inserts the handle, then performs positional I/O.
7. Eviction removes the cache reference, while in-flight jobs retain their
   shared handle until completion.

Reads, recheck, and verification use **open existing** and must never create an
empty destination. Writes use **open or create** only after the routing and
selection plan says the destination is wanted. This distinction prevents
startup or conservative recheck from eagerly materializing the torrent tree.

## Session-Wide File Pool

The file pool is owned by the application service's shared storage/disk owner,
not by one torrent. Its initial scope is the one active profile/service
instance. If simultaneous profiles are later authorized, a process-level owner
must bound their aggregate descriptors rather than multiplying this limit per
profile.

Keys identify both storage ownership and file role. Payload keys include a
torrent/storage identity, namespace generation, and file index. Auxiliary keys
include at least the selective part file. Root repair advances the namespace
generation and invalidates entries that can no longer name the same provider
documents.

The pool follows the pinned libtorrent behavior:

- one global least-recently-used order across torrents;
- a hit moves the entry to most recently used;
- a miss at capacity evicts the least recently used entry;
- concurrent compatible opens of one key share one acquisition;
- a write request upgrades or replaces an insufficient read-only entry;
- an in-flight job retains an `Arc` even after cache eviction; and
- close and other potentially blocking destruction occurs outside the pool
  lock.

The initial design target is 40 open storage files per service, matching
libtorrent's ordinary default. It is an advanced runtime setting, not initial
UI. The implementation must count actual operating-system descriptors rather
than logical entries, retain a reserve for peer sockets and other process
resources, and report the observed descriptor high-water. The current
two-descriptor `RetainedFile` shape should be reduced to one underlying owned
descriptor per cached file when compatible with positional I/O and durability;
otherwise the limit must charge both descriptors explicitly.

The platform broker also needs a much smaller bound on simultaneous pending
opens so a burst of misses cannot transiently exceed the steady-state pool.
The implementation tactical must justify that value with controlled Android
evidence rather than treating every metainfo file as independent concurrency.

An entry participating in an uncommitted durability epoch cannot be made
unsafe by eviction. The checkpoint owner retains its shared handle until the
required payload sync completes and the corresponding verified-state commit is
allowed. Removing the LRU reference never cancels an in-flight read, write,
hash, materialization, or sync.

No per-torrent reserved quota or fairness layer is initially required. A
global LRU makes the working set, rather than torrent file count, consume the
budget. Hit/miss and provider-latency evidence can justify later root-aware or
fairness policy.

## File Selection And Part Storage

The SAF backend adopts the live selection semantics already proven for path
storage:

- `Normal` to `Skip` changes routing and future piece demand. It does not
  delete, truncate, rename, or move an existing destination into the part
  file. Its cached handle may age out normally.
- `Skip` to `Normal` makes the destination eligible. The first materialization
  or payload write dynamically opens or creates it, and Rust exports verified
  part spans through the shared storage implementation.
- A boundary piece remains requested and verified when any non-padding span
  is wanted.
- A skipped destination absent from the provider remains absent until a real
  wanted write needs it.

The selective part artifact is also dynamic. Merely constructing or restoring
storage must not create it. The first write routed to a part slot requests its
document, writes through the returned descriptor, and places that descriptor
under the same session resource budget. When the final slot is released, Rust
fences and releases the handle before asking Kotlin to delete the empty owned
document.

Part payload and metadata remain Rust-owned. Kotlin neither interprets part
slots nor copies bytes between the part document and payload documents.

## Direct Restart And Repair

Wanted writes find or create their exact final documents and remain there
through completion. A synchronized ordinary resume may trust committed have
evidence only after the accepted structural observations. Missing or
disagreeing documents, Force recheck, and no-state existing data enter the
common bounded checker against those same direct documents. Matching pieces
survive; missing, short, or corrupt spans remain work. No restart path renames
a provider document or waits for namespace confirmation.

Tactical `191`'s API 34 no-window profile proves fresh multifile direct
download, process restart, Force recheck, exact upload from final documents,
selective skipped-file absence and part storage, exact removal, cancellation,
schema reset, and grant repair under the established bounds.

Repair preserves the stable root ID while replacing or refreshing its platform
locator. It invalidates every pool entry under the old capability before work
resumes. Grant loss leaves torrents waiting for repair. It never silently
falls back to application-private storage or another root.

## Failure And Security Invariants

- All provider paths derive from bounded, validated metainfo components and a
  trusted engine-owned role. No presentation string becomes a provider path.
- Per-path creation is serialized. Providers that silently deduplicate a name
  to `name (1)` or another sibling must be detected; a mismatched document is
  not accepted as the requested canonical destination.
- Cloud-backed providers remain unsupported until they prove seekable,
  durable positioned I/O and the required restart behavior. A tree grant alone
  is not that evidence.
- Descriptor duplication failure, an invalid descriptor, mode mismatch, or
  provider refusal inserts no cache entry and leaks neither the Kotlin nor Rust
  handle.
- `EMFILE` or equivalent resource pressure evicts eligible LRU entries and may
  retry acquisition once. Continued failure becomes an observable bounded
  storage error rather than unbounded eviction or a busy loop.
- No cache, broker, publication, repair, cancellation, or shutdown path closes
  a descriptor still used by an in-flight operation.
- Cancellation removes pending requests for the generation. Late descriptor
  responses are closed without mutating replacement state.
- An externally missing document or revoked grant invalidates the relevant
  entry/root and invokes ordinary conservative storage recovery. It cannot
  establish or preserve a false verified claim.

## Observability

The shared storage owner must expose bounded structured counters for:

- configured file-pool limit and current/high-water actual descriptors;
- hits, misses, evictions, mode upgrades, and open failures;
- same-key single-flight waits and read/write acquisition races;
- pending and high-water platform requests;
- provider open/create latency and result class by storage root;
- part-file acquisitions and deletions;
- invalidations caused by repair, provider errors, or external
  disappearance; and
- resource-limit retries and terminal exhaustion.

These are diagnostics and Disk-view inputs, not a second application command
stream. Paths, SAF URIs, document IDs, and raw descriptors must not be logged.

## Reference Findings

### Pinned libtorrent

The required oracle is libtorrent at
`7d7fc38fac61177fa5e02148f791b2f65250b09d`, pinned in
[`../../reference/pins.toml`](../../reference/pins.toml).

- `include/libtorrent/settings_pack.hpp::file_pool_size` defines a session
  upper bound on retained open files.
- `src/settings_pack.cpp` defaults the pool to 40;
  `src/session.cpp::{min_memory_usage,high_performance_seed}` uses 4 and 500.
- `include/libtorrent/aux_/file_view_pool.hpp` and
  `src/file_view_pool.cpp::open_file` implement the session-wide
  `(storage_index, file_index)` LRU, compatible-open single-flight,
  read/write upgrade, deferred close, resize, and release behavior.
- `src/mmap_disk_io.cpp` owns one pool for all torrent storage instances and
  records hits, misses, stalls, races, and current size.
- `simulation/test_file_pool.cpp::file_pool_size` constructs a 144-file
  torrent, configures five entries, and proves the observed high-water remains
  within five while the transfer completes.
- `src/mmap_storage.cpp::need_partfile` constructs part storage only when
  selection requires it; `src/part_file.cpp` opens the artifact per operation,
  creates its directory only for a write, and retains no eager payload handle.

RSTorrent adopts the resource and ownership semantics, not libtorrent's C++
multi-index container, mmap policy, public API, or architecture.

### JSTorrent Android

The local sibling was inspected at
`9895410beeed6aff554053769bd006a3fbd373ef` on 2026-08-03.

- `packages/engine/src/adapters/native/native-filesystem.ts` represents an
  open handle as `(root key, relative path)` without creating a document.
- `android/quickjs-engine/.../FileBindings.kt` resolves root keys and sends
  only actual reads and writes to `FileManager`.
- `android/io-core/.../FileManagerImpl.kt` creates missing parents and files on
  the first write, never on a missing read, opens `ParcelFileDescriptor` in
  `rw` mode, and uses `Os.pread`/`Os.pwrite` with a `FileChannel` fallback.
- Its Android SAF handle pool defaults to 32 handles and its per-path and
  per-directory locks defend against concurrent provider deduplication.
- `packages/engine/src/core/parts-file.ts` checks existence without creation,
  creates the info-hash-named auxiliary file on its first nonempty flush, and
  deletes it when empty.
- `FileManagerSafTest.kt` and `FileManagerConcurrencyTest.kt` cover nested
  on-demand creation, positioned round trips, deletion, and concurrent SAF
  directory creation.

JSTorrent demonstrates the platform capability and records valuable provider
failure history. RSTorrent does not adopt its per-read JavaScript/Kotlin data
bridge; after acquisition, payload I/O remains in Rust.

## Current Evidence And Known Gaps

- Tactical `191`'s API 34 `jstorrent-tablet` product profiles pass direct
  multifile download, restart reconstruction, Force recheck, 133,304-byte
  upload from final documents, selective skipped-file absence, exact removal,
  cancellation, schema 21-to-22 reset with byte-exact external sentinels, and
  grant loss/repair. The direct lifecycle peaks at 6/40 owned handles, 2/16
  pending requests, and 139 process descriptors from a 118 baseline; the
  schema-reset profile peaks at 6/40 and 3/16.
- Deterministic pool coverage proves 10,000 logical file keys across 100
  torrent identities, compatible single-flight, access upgrade, stale
  completion fencing, late responses, and exact handle accounting.
- Fake-platform selective storage proves lazy construction, payload and part
  routing, positioned Rust hashing, namespace rename, and fresh dynamic
  published verification.
- Three fresh product-path AVD cycles report a native descriptor high water of
  6/40 and pending-request high water of 3/16. Whole-process baselines were
  106/107/113 descriptors and observed high water was 137. Every published
  non-padding file matched SHA-1; no info-hash directory, staging namespace,
  or empty part artifact survived.
- The current resource snapshot exposes pool and request counters, but
  provider latency histograms, typed result counts, and Disk-view presentation
  remain follow-up observability work.
- Tactical `116` repeats the complete dynamic product lifecycle on a no-window
  API 34 AVD and a physical Android 17/API 37 device. Download, selective
  publication, forced restart, conservative verification reconstruction,
  Force recheck, SAF-backed upload to pinned libtorrent, removal, grant
  loss/repair, cancellation before and after stored data, and exact staging,
  part, and published cleanup all pass.
- Three concurrent dynamic downloads retain two active generations and one
  queued generation. The one permitted checker may overlap a promoted
  download, producing a terminal registered high water of three; every live
  resource count returns to zero. The shared pool peaks at 11/40 and broker
  pending work at 3/16 on both device classes.
- Tactical `081` passes both target-architecture Rust builds, generated UniFFI
  Kotlin compilation, APK assembly, and JVM tests. Its high-cardinality test
  represents 374,998 wanted files as one range while consuming one 1,024-row
  catalog page; no eager descriptor manifest is reconstructed.
- Tactical `116` makes SAF upload reads use the same logical artifact layout,
  `StorageFileReference`, 40-handle pool, ten-read admission, verified/readable
  availability, and joined lifecycle as path upload. Independent libtorrent
  leechers verify the exact 133,304-byte fixture on both device classes.
- The broker now observes exact artifacts without opening or creating them and
  returns existence, kind, length, and a bounded opaque token when available.
  Provider identifiers and URIs remain in Kotlin. Root restore and repair
  exercise that observation before admitting torrent work, while later grant
  or provider failure transitions the root back to unavailable.
- Tactical `120`'s API 34 no-window AVD retained two checkpoint claims, killed
  the process after provider rename, restarted through fresh published checking,
  matched the 256 KiB payload SHA-1, failed closed on revoked grant, joined
  foreground shutdown, and removed the owned tree. A second reactive run
  completed eight pieces and joined notification stop. These gates exposed
  and closed broker receivers blocked during cancellation and four Kotlin
  provider workers racing UniFFI client destruction; service shutdown now
  wakes, joins, and only then closes those owners.
- Tactical `124`'s API 34 no-window AVD exchanges four Piece frames in each
  direction before completion sequence 7, verifies all wanted Android and
  oracle hashes, excludes skipped/padding publication, and records 7/40
  Rust-owned handles, 2/16 pending provider requests, and process-descriptor
  high water 140 from baseline 118. Grant loss enters awaiting storage;
  repair resumes the same partial torrent; exact application removal and AVD
  cleanup pass.

Implementation-complete Tactical
[`207`](../tactical/207-android-safe-reset-and-clear-data.md) now uses this exact
removal and grant-repair boundary for the product clear-data workflow. Android
serializes at most one delete job, keeps a failed grant until retry or an
explicit keep-files downgrade, and never substitutes recursive tree deletion.
Only after every removal is terminal does the coordinator release captured
retained grants and reset the fixed private product profile. Existing exact-
document, unrelated-sentinel, wrong-kind, provider-refusal, and missing-file
tests pass. Its owned API 35 multi-root campaign preserves unrelated root and
nested sentinels through Keep, removes only registered files through
DeleteData, recovers after the first durable delete cursor is interrupted by
process death, and removes both task roots. Physical ChromeOS qualification
remains open.

## Recommended Next Work

Do not restore or extend the diagnostic-only fixed-manifest or publication
APIs. Preserve Tactical `194`'s bounded retained-root registry and
extension-triggered picker plus its exact ARC-address transport boundary.
Desktop-shaped per-add choice among old roots, cloud/removable
provider support, relocation, and an exposed advanced file-pool setting still
require their own product decisions.
Completed Tactical `120` consumes exact existence, kind, and length as
per-torrent fast-resume admission evidence for the supported local provider.
It adds no persisted provider-token snapshot; absence of the optional opaque
token alone does not force checking. Checker-readable disagreement falls back
only that torrent, unavailable capability remains awaiting repair, and Force
recheck always hashes. Additional provider classes still require their own
capability and lifecycle evidence.
