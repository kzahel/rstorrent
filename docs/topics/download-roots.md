# Download Roots And Add Options

Topic: `download-roots`

Status: Tactical
[`191`](../tactical/191-direct-filesystem-storage.md) completes the direct
root-relative content model across path, Android SAF, and qualified iOS roots.
Wanted files are final-path files from their first write, existing bytes enter
the common checker, and exact delete-data removal preserves unrelated root
content. Earlier publication tacticals below remain historical evidence.

Completed Tactical
[`193`](../tactical/193-stateless-foreground-downloader.md) adds one path-only
foreground surface whose `--output` value is the final root capability. It
creates a missing directory, canonicalizes its native identity, obtains a
same-user CLI lock, proves create/write/sync/remove access before content, and
then uses the ordinary root-relative layout below. No durable root record or
picker/default-root policy is created, and other products do not participate
in this cooperative lock.

Completed Tactical
[`188`](../tactical/188-existing-payload-adoption-and-recheck.md) replaces a
fresh-row destination collision with automatic metainfo-exact discovery and
the common complete checker. Discovered bytes remain unverified until hashing
passes, ownership and pending verification commit atomically, and managed
removal preserves unrelated content. Product behavior accepted in maintainer
discussion on 2026-08-03 and
implemented for the macOS code paths and initial native Linux adapter in
[`061-user-selected-download-roots.md`](../tactical/061-user-selected-download-roots.md).
[`062-user-visible-publication-layout.md`](../tactical/062-user-visible-publication-layout.md)
introduced recognizable multi-file publication beneath those roots. Tactical
[`073`](../tactical/073-unified-storage-and-complete-recheck.md) completes the
same durable file/tree topology for BEP 3 single-file and multi-file forms.
Fresh desktop and manual-WebUI profiles no longer install an implicit
app-data-backed payload root. The shared add flow requires a chosen folder,
retains a torrent-specific opaque root ID, and provides durable default,
preference, add, repair, and bounded removal controls. Store, adapter, React,
and headless-browser evidence passes. Linux Zenity WebUI evidence covers
choose/cancel, first default, exact per-torrent roots, restart, repair cancel,
and unavailable paths; the same command/persistence behaviors pass through
the local WebUI gateway. Completed Tactical
[`161`](../tactical/161-packaged-desktop-folder-picker.md) gives packaged Tauri
a parented native picker without a Zenity/KDialog runtime dependency. Its
focused tests and installed Windows campaign pass cancel, first default,
restart, unavailable-root repair under the same stable ID, and repaired
restart. Hosted Linux x86_64 AppImage testing passes, but installed Linux
desktop/portal interaction remains unclaimed. Tactical `063` adds the
checked-by-default start-content option, metadata-only intake with no payload
artifact, and live path-backed file selection in the Files tab. A manual
macOS chooser/restart smoke also
remains required because Computer Use cannot attach to the transient system
folder panel. Tactical
[`178`](../tactical/178-crostini-storage-guidance.md) retains Crostini's fast
Linux `~/Downloads` default while making the exact ChromeOS Files visibility,
**Share with Linux**, picker path, and measured shared-storage performance
tradeoff visible only on the exact Crostini product. Tactical `076` lets a
headless private host install one explicit
configured payload root while making the native picker unavailable; it does
not add ambient remote path authority or change durable root identity.
Maintainer direction on 2026-08-29 accepts validated absolute server-path
entry for the exact Linux headless product. That unimplemented platform
operation and the current cross-runtime picker matrix are owned by
[`download-root-acquisition.md`](download-root-acquisition.md); portable add
commands continue to carry only opaque root IDs.
Android already proves one user-selected persisted SAF root. Active Tactical
[`194`](../tactical/194-chromeos-android-extension-control.md) now owns its
replacement with a retained multi-root grant registry plus extension-triggered
SAF acquisition: one root is current for future downloads while previous
roots remain authoritative for torrents already bound to them. The maintained
iOS
product now supports app Documents plus distinct qualified selected roots.
Tactical
[`116`](../tactical/116-platform-storage-coherence-and-ios-feasibility.md)
physically proves app-owned Documents and coordinated, security-scoped
restoration of an app-owned bookmarked fixture. Completed Tactical
[`123`](../tactical/123-ios-on-device-root-persistence-and-recovery.md)
proves stable app-owned persistence and interrupted recovery. Its later
physical picker controls reject iCloud as ubiquitous but leave a distinct
**On My iPhone** directory unclassifiable after the public File Provider
lookup fails. Explicit maintainer direction on 2026-08-13 superseded that
product conclusion. Completed Tactical `147` implements the picker and accepts
that exact lookup-failure shape only for a non-ubiquitous local/internal root
that passes the full bounded Rust capability and recovery matrix. Physical
transfer, restart, Force recheck, unavailable-root repair with stable opaque
identity, managed removal, and independent empty-folder evidence pass. A
positive provider identity and iCloud remain rejected.

Completed Tactical
[`138`](../tactical/138-verified-http-file-serving.md) consumes stable root
identity, availability, publication layout, and path/platform observation when
authorizing one verified-file URL. It neither exposes the locator in that URL
nor changes root selection, persistence, repair, relocation, or provider
policy. Root loss makes the file typed unavailable and revokes applicable
capabilities through the existing storage transition.

## Scope

This topic owns the product meaning and user experience of download roots:

- how a first usable root is acquired;
- how roots are named, persisted, selected, defaulted, checked, repaired, and
  removed;
- how an add flow chooses a root without exposing ambient paths on the
  application command boundary;
- which behavior is shared across desktop, the local browser presentation, and
  Android despite different platform capabilities;
- what belongs in application-private storage versus a user-visible content
  location; and
- the intended user-visible publication layout beneath a root.

It complements:

- [`client-persistence.md`](client-persistence.md), which owns stable root
  identity, SQLite records, verified resume, and cross-platform portability;
- [`application-control.md`](application-control.md), which owns semantic
  commands and the platform-capability boundary;
- [`product-surfaces-and-migration.md`](product-surfaces-and-migration.md),
  which owns backend/profile isolation and later JSTorrent import root
  remapping;
- [`web-ui-design.md`](web-ui-design.md), which owns the shared React
  presentation and browser-local versus durable state; and
- [`storage-throughput-architecture.md`](storage-throughput-architecture.md),
  which owns content I/O, staging, hashing, durability, and root-level resource
  scheduling; and
- [`android-saf-storage.md`](android-saf-storage.md), which owns dynamic SAF
  document acquisition, descriptor lifetime, and the platform namespace/Rust
  payload boundary beneath an established root; and
- [`download-root-acquisition.md`](download-root-acquisition.md), which owns
  exact picker implementations, availability by runtime, and the Linux
  headless typed-path boundary.

This topic does not implement torrent relocation, automatic content import,
numeric or piece priorities, fast resume, browser filesystem I/O, or dynamic
Android SAF descriptor replacement.

## Terms And Ownership

A **download root** is a long-lived, user-visible base location into which the
application may publish torrent content. It is not the application-data
directory, a torrent-specific final path, or an arbitrary path supplied by a
presentation.

A root has a stable opaque **root ID** used by the application service,
database, commands, and torrent records. The ID is not an absolute path, SAF
URI, descriptor number, browser handle, or hash whose identity changes when a
locator is repaired. A root also has bounded display metadata and an explicit
availability or permission state.

The ownership split is:

- the application service and profile database own the root registry, stable
  root IDs, default root, availability visible to application views, and each
  torrent's selected root;
- the platform adapter owns acquisition and reopening of the operating-system
  locator or capability, such as a desktop path, future macOS persistent access
  token, or Android SAF tree grant;
- the engine owns safe relative torrent layout, staging, verification,
  publication, and content I/O beneath an already resolved capability; and
- the presentation requests semantic root selection and displays established
  roots, but does not become filesystem authority.

The default root and root registry are durable profile/application state. They
are shared by every presentation attached to the same backend and are not
browser-local preferences. A setting that skips add options also changes add
behavior and therefore belongs to the profile rather than one browser tab.

## Accepted User Experience

### Fresh profile and first add

A fresh product profile has no implicit payload root. Application-private
storage contains the profile database, settings, exact metadata, and bounded
application-owned support state, but not ordinary torrent payload.

Do not ask for a folder merely because the application launched. On the first
user-initiated torrent add:

1. present the add options;
2. explain that a download folder is required;
3. offer **Choose folder...** in that flow;
4. acquire the folder through the local platform adapter;
5. register it as a stable root and make this first root the default; and
6. start content only after the add is confirmed with a usable root.

If the picker is cancelled or permission is denied, retain the user's add
input while the dialog remains useful, but do not create payload or report a
successful download start.

There is no automatic product fallback to an app-data `downloads` directory.
There is also no later automatic move from hidden storage. Moving partial or
complete content requires joined torrent ownership, crash-safe rename or
copy, cross-volume handling, conservative recheck, rollback, and exact cleanup
and is a separate feature.

### Default root and per-add choice

The root and preference policy follows the current JSTorrent behavior, with
the deliberate simpler add dialog recorded below:

- **Show options when adding torrents** defaults on.
- The add dialog preselects the current default root and checks the independent
  start-content option. File selection stays in the Files tab.
- The first configured root becomes the default automatically.
- Selecting a different established root for one torrent does not silently
  change the default.
- Making a later root the default is an explicit Settings action or a clearly
  labeled per-add choice.
- **Don't show again** is an accessible shortcut for turning off the add-option
  preference. Settings can turn it back on.
- When add options are off, an ordinary add uses the available default root
  and starts all files. A missing, unavailable, or permission-lost default
  overrides that preference and requires root selection or repair.

Changing the default affects future torrents only. Every accepted torrent is
pinned to the root selected for that add. It is never silently redirected
because another root becomes the default.

### Root settings and repair

Settings should expose a **Downloads** or **Storage** section with:

- the current default root;
- registered roots with useful labels, local location display where policy
  permits it, availability, permission state, and free space when supported;
- **Add folder...**, **Make default**, **Repair/Re-select**, and bounded removal
  actions; and
- an explanation that changing the default does not move existing torrents.

Repair updates the platform locator or capability behind the same stable root
identity after appropriate validation. It does not rewrite every torrent to a
new root ID or trust prior verified state without the normal storage checks.

A root referenced by retained torrents cannot be removed as if it were unused.
The product must require those torrents to be removed, retained in an explicit
unavailable state, or deliberately relocated by a later feature. Removing an
unreferenced default root either requires choosing a replacement or leaves the
profile with no usable default; it does not silently remap existing torrents.

An unavailable root is a missing prerequisite, not evidence that torrent
metadata, the database, or verified-piece state is corrupt. Preserve user
intent and expose an actionable waiting/repair state.

## Implemented Root And Start-Content Flow

The shared add dialog intentionally stays small. It selects one established
root and exposes one checked-by-default option: **Start downloading files when
metadata is available**. It does not contain a file tree or a second selection
modal.

When that option is cleared, the normal durable torrent record and metadata
worker remain the only owners. BEP 9 metadata is acquired and verified while
durable content intent is paused. No output directory, staging tree, wanted
file, or part file is created. Once metadata is available, the user opens the
ordinary Files tab, changes any non-padding file between `Normal` and `Skip`,
and presses Start. That selection is durable and shared by every presentation.

The root behavior remains unchanged: a fresh profile still requires a folder,
a per-add root does not change the default, and hiding add options uses the
usable default with start-content enabled. The metadata-only choice is not
remembered as a hidden policy.

Future `.torrent` byte intake may begin with metadata already present, but it
should use this same root, start-content, and Files-tab selection model. A
staged file-picker dialog is not current direction. Duplicate intake,
pre-metadata cancellation, and `.torrent` source handling remain separate
work rather than reasons to introduce a second pending-add authority now.

## Desktop, WebUI, And Remote Boundaries

The shared React surface expresses **choose a download folder** as a platform
operation. It never sends an ambient path inside `add_magnet`, another portable
application command, or browser-local persistence.

- Tauri asks its native platform adapter to open the folder picker and install
  the resulting root capability.
- The local `./scripts/webui` backend may expose the same trusted local
  operation over its authenticated or explicitly development-scoped
  connection. The gateway process, not the browser sandbox, resolves and owns
  the filesystem capability.
- A generic remote or relayed presentation may select an already established
  root. It cannot register a path merely by submitting a string or claiming a
  product identity. The exact Linux headless runtime may advertise a distinct
  validated server-path operation; the backend installs the locator and
  returns an opaque root ID. Other transports without a safe acquisition
  operation direct the user to the owning product to add or repair a root.
- Tactical `194`'s authenticated same-device ChromeOS Android presentation is
  such a safe acquisition operation. It invokes the Android-owned SAF picker
  through the existing `chooseDownloadRoot` platform seam and receives only
  the installed root snapshot; URI, document, descriptor, and intent values
  never cross into React or the application connection.

Do not use the browser File System Access API as an engine storage backend and
do not move piece payload through the web presentation. Browser directory
handles cannot supply the native Rust engine's durable cross-platform storage
authority and would violate the existing hot-path boundary.

Interactive `./scripts/webui` should not silently create or select
`.local/webui/downloads`. Keep an explicit environment/CLI root injection for
developer workflows, controlled harnesses, and headless automation. Such a
root is visibly preconfigured rather than inferred as product consent.
Automated tests continue to use isolated temporary roots and never open a
visible picker.

## Platform Behavior

### macOS and other desktop platforms

On a fresh macOS profile, start the folder picker at Home rather than probing
or defaulting to Downloads. After the user has established roots, start at the
most recent usable root when the platform can do so without an unrelated
permission prompt. This follows the current JSTorrent behavior and keeps any
Downloads access request in the context of the user's explicit choice.

The platform adapter must detect denial and lost access on restart. A plain
path may be sufficient for the initial unsandboxed desktop build, but the root
model must permit a future platform-specific persistent capability without
changing portable commands or torrent records.

The local WebUI gateway's Linux adapter invokes Zenity, then KDialog when
Zenity is absent, behind its `rstorrent-platform` operation. Packaged Tauri
instead uses `tauri-plugin-dialog` from Rust, with the invoking webview window
as parent. The selected native `PathBuf` goes directly to the application
service; JavaScript receives no dialog permission or path authority. Installed
Windows evidence proves the common first-root, default, repair, and restart
semantics. Installed Linux picker interaction remains a release gate rather
than being inferred from its hosted package build.

### ChromeOS Linux (Crostini)

The Crostini package installs Linux `~/Downloads` as its initial root. This is
the recommended performance path. ChromeOS Files already exposes that content
under **Linux files > Downloads**, so a user does not share or copy it merely
to find completed files from ChromeOS.

The reverse direction requires explicit authority. To let RSTorrent write to
ChromeOS **My files**, the user opens Files, right-clicks **Downloads** or
another folder below **My files**, and selects **Share with Linux**. The
existing RSTorrent **Choose folder...** or **Add folder...** action can then
select `/mnt/chromeos/MyFiles/Downloads` (or the corresponding shared path).
The picker remains the capability-acquisition boundary; React neither grants
sharing nor submits an ambient path. Product guidance tells the user to
select the folder just shared; it does not require `Ctrl+L` or expose the
Linux mount path as a user workflow.

Physical x86_64 Chromebook evidence in Tactical `178` found the shared 9P path
materially slower than Crostini-local Btrfs: median sequential reads were
48.6x slower, durable sequential and scattered writes were about 2x slower,
and four concurrent durable writers were 5.5x slower across five alternating
128 MiB trials. Small 128-file durable publication was approximately equal.
These values are device evidence, not universal product promises. The UI
therefore says only that Linux Downloads is faster/recommended and ChromeOS
sharing is convenient but can be much slower, especially for download,
checking, reading, and seeding.

Exact `rstorrent-crostini` health identity gates this help. A path under
`/mnt/chromeos` may receive a shared/slower label and a path matching
`/home/<user>/Downloads` may receive a faster/recommended label, but only
within that identified product. Generic Linux, Tauri, headless, Android, and
iOS surfaces do not infer ChromeOS from hostnames, user agents, or path text.

### Android and ChromeOS Android

Android continues to use a persisted SAF tree selected through the system
picker. SAF URI and grant state stay in the platform adapter; SQLite and
portable application values retain the stable root ID. A revoked grant leaves
the torrent waiting for repair rather than selecting app-private storage.

Tactical `194` replaces the former singleton URI with a bounded retained-root
registry shared by Compose and the extension presentation. At most one root is
current/default for future Android downloads; if it is unavailable, new work
waits for repair or an explicit current-root change. Selecting a new tree
adds or deduplicates a stable root and makes it current only after its grant and
probe succeed; it never redirects an existing torrent. Previous roots and
their grants remain available to torrents already bound to them, and a healthy
one may be made current explicitly. Repair replaces the locator behind the
same root ID, while removal releases a grant only after the root is neither
current nor referenced.

Android **current root** is presentation wording for the ordinary durable
default root, not a second platform-owned setting. Compose and React therefore
cannot disagree about which root receives future downloads.

The React interaction remains aligned with Crostini: **Choose folder...** and
**Repair...** call the same platform capability. Crostini's adapter opens a
Linux picker and installs a path root; Android's adapter opens the SAF picker
and installs a platform root. Android does not offer previous retained roots
as new per-torrent overrides in this slice. Multi-root support exists to
preserve earlier torrent authority across a current-root change, not to imply
relocation or arbitrary provider support.

### iOS and iPadOS

The native iOS product uses the same stable root ID and per-torrent
binding semantics. The platform adapter, not SQLite or Rust domain state, owns
an app-container URL or user-selected directory bookmark, security-scope
lifetime, File Provider coordination, stale-bookmark repair, and permission
failure. An unresolved bookmark leaves the torrent waiting for repair; it
must never redirect an established root to app-private Documents merely
because the display name or path is unavailable.

Tactical `116` proves app-owned Documents plus non-stale bookmark restoration,
balanced security scope, and coordination around Rust-owned I/O on a physical
device. Tactical `123` adds a versioned opaque app-owned record, generation-
fenced interrupted-workspace recovery, exact resource accounting, and the
physical observation that **On My iPhone** reports
`provider_lookup_failed/ubiquitous=false/local=true/internal=true` while iCloud
reports `ubiquitous=true` with the same volume flags. Tactical `147` explicitly
replaces classification-only behavior with a product gate: reject ubiquitous,
nonlocal, external-volume, symlink, overlapping, and positively identified
provider roots; when provider lookup fails, accept only after bounded Rust
qualification and physical persistence/recovery evidence. Support wording
must remain “qualified on-device folder,” because the public facts do not
prove every possible provider identity. Offloaded, iCloud, identified third-
party provider, relocation, and cloud-export behavior remain unsupported.
Completed Tactical `152` narrows each descriptor's long-lived coordination
lease to its exact validated file while retaining the selected-root security
scope through Rust's final pooled handle. Controlled three-file and public
Big Buck Bunny physical runs prove sibling files, nested parents, atomic tree
publication, restart/Force recheck, completed-file handoff, and exact managed
cleanup beneath one qualified external root.
Completed Tactical `154` retains that shareable-file security scope through a
direct Quick Look presentation instead of a generic share-sheet hop. A second
real-swarm Big Buck Bunny run reaches Complete/Published, advances native video
playback, releases the preview lease on dismissal, removes managed data, and
independently shows the selected folder at zero items in Apple Files.

## User-Visible Content Layout

Tactical [`191`](../tactical/191-direct-filesystem-storage.md) implements the
accepted model in [`direct-filesystem-storage.md`](direct-filesystem-storage.md).
Tacticals `062`, `073`, and `188` remain historical records of the removed
staging/publication design and the checker behavior carried forward.

The accepted root-relative layout is direct:

- a single-file torrent stores content as `<root>/<filename>`; and
- a multi-file torrent stores content as `<root>/<torrent name>/...` using its
  safe metainfo-relative tree.

Fresh wanted bytes are written to those final paths rather than a hidden
full-payload staging namespace. Existing expected files are normal candidates
for the common checker: only hash-matching pieces are retained, while missing,
short, or corrupt work downloads normally. Automatic suffixing, blind
overwrite, and treating same-length files as verified remain rejected.

The hidden part artifact remains only when selective piece boundaries require
storage for bytes belonging to skipped files. Exact delete-data cleanup removes
metainfo files and that validated auxiliary state, then prunes only empty
expected directories. It does not claim recursive ownership of the selected
root or preserve the `managed data` product concept.

## JSTorrent Product Cheat Sheet

JSTorrent is the first-party behavior and terminology reference for this
topic. The sibling checkout is declared in [`../../reference/pins.toml`](../../reference/pins.toml)
as `../jstorrent`, normally available at `~/code/jstorrent`. This topic was
written after inspecting sibling commit
`9895410beeed6aff554053769bd006a3fbd373ef` on 2026-08-03.

Before implementing a root or add-options tactical, inspect the then-current
sibling `main` and record any changed behavior. These paths are the useful
starting map, relative to the JSTorrent repository root:

| Concern | JSTorrent path or symbol | Lesson to retain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default add preference | `packages/engine/src/config/config-schema.ts::showFileSelection` | Showing file/location options defaults on. |
| User-add policy | `packages/client/src/utils/add-torrent-options.ts::getUserAddTorrentOptions` | User adds honor the preference; restore and diagnostic paths do not pretend to be user adds. |
| Pending metadata and confirmation | `packages/client/src/AppContent.tsx` file-selection queue and confirm handlers | Metadata can be fetched without content; RSTorrent retains that property with durable paused intent rather than a modal-owned queue. |
| Combined dialog | `packages/ui/src/components/FileSelectionModal.tsx` | JSTorrent combines root and file choice; RSTorrent intentionally keeps only root/start intent in Add and uses the ordinary Files tab for selection. |
| First root and default | `packages/client/src/App.tsx` root setup handlers | The first usable root becomes default; later changes are explicit. |
| Root settings | `packages/client/src/components/SettingsOverlay.tsx` | Roots can be added, defaulted, removed with warning, and paired with the add-options preference. |
| Root/default synchronization | `packages/client/src/engine-manager/daemon-engine-manager.ts` | Root inventory, persisted default, live engine state, and platform host state must be reconciled deliberately. |
| Per-torrent root resolution | `packages/engine/src/storage/storage-root-manager.ts` | A torrent-specific root overrides the default; missing roots fail explicitly. |
| Root in resume state | `packages/engine/src/core/session-persistence.ts` | Each torrent's chosen storage key survives restart. |
| Desktop folder picker | `desktop/host/src/folder_picker.rs` | Start at a recent usable root or Home on macOS, deduplicate roots, and return a stable registered root. |
| Android root persistence | `android/app/src/main/java/com/jstorrent/app/storage/RootStore.kt` | Persist SAF roots outside the engine and resolve opaque keys through the platform owner. |
| Android add/file choice | `android/app/src/main/java/com/jstorrent/app/ui/dialogs/FileSelectionDialog.kt` | Use the same default-root and initial-file-choice semantics in a platform-appropriate UI. |
| Android first-root setup | `android/app/src/main/java/com/jstorrent/app/AddRootActivity.kt` and `ui/screens/StorageSettingsScreen.kt` | The first root becomes default and later root management remains explicit. |

Use JSTorrent as a UX and failure-history reference, not an architecture or
source donor. RSTorrent does not adopt its extension engine, native-host/IO
daemon topology, ConfigHub persistence shape, mutable engine objects, path-
derived root identity, or mixed React/Compose implementation. No JSTorrent
source, fixture, or asset is imported by this topic.

## Invariants

- Ordinary product payload never defaults to application-private storage.
- Content I/O cannot begin without one usable, durably selected root.
- The first selected root becomes default; a one-torrent override does not.
- Default-root changes affect future adds only.
- A torrent refers to a stable root ID, never an ambient path or descriptor.
- Platform locator loss becomes an actionable unavailable state, not silent
  remapping or false corruption.
- Android SAF and eventual Apple bookmarks/URLs remain platform-owned
  capabilities; neither is serialized as a portable locator or interpreted by
  another backend.
- Presentations cannot grant native filesystem authority by sending strings.
- Root removal, repair/recheck, direct content access, and later relocation
  never silently move, overwrite, merge, or trust content.
- Interactive and headless add paths distinguish user consent from explicit
  developer/test root injection.
- Metadata-only add may perform bounded metadata networking and parsing but
  cannot create a payload, staging, or part artifact.

Ready Tactical
[`207`](../tactical/207-android-safe-reset-and-clear-data.md) composes the
existing exact per-torrent keep/delete removal contracts for Android clear
data. Delete mode remains manifest-based, retains a failed root grant for
repair and retry, and releases each retained grant only after no registered
torrent needs it. Neither mode recursively deletes a selected root; keep mode
does not open or alter registered payload or part artifacts.

## Recommended Next Work

Preserve Tactical `194`'s implemented Android retained-root/current-default
model and React folder action through the Android-owned SAF picker. Its
physical two-root binding, independent grant loss/repair, restart, and cleanup
evidence passes, as does the separate extension transport's exact ARC bind and
same-LAN refusal. Preserve completed Tactical `191`'s direct layout,
stable per-torrent root binding, root-specific broker routing, and exact
cleanup across every retained grant.

Tactical `161` provides one native Tauri dialog implementation for Windows,
packaged Linux, and macOS while leaving the local WebUI helper implementation
unchanged. Prove installed Windows choose/cancel/restart behavior and retain
hosted Linux package evidence. Separately close the remaining manual macOS
chooser/restart evidence in Tactical 061 and resolve the Linux WebKitGTK
live-bootstrap failure before claiming rendered Tauri parity. Keep
first-root, stable-ID, default, repair, and per-torrent semantics identical
while allowing native capability handling to differ.

Tactical 073 completes the unified single-/multi-file publication and managed
resume slice, and Tactical 063 completes the current metadata-only/live-
selection flow.
Later intake work should add `.torrent` sources or pre-metadata cancellation
without moving file selection out of the Files tab.
Completed Tactical `116` adds backend-neutral observations and root-health
semantics, closes SAF published reads, and records bounded physical iOS root
feasibility without implementing fast resume or a complete iOS client.
Completed Tactical `123` records the historical app-owned-only result.
Completed Tactical `147` is the qualified-selected-root successor;
completed Tactical `152` closes qualified-root multifile coordination and
publication with physical and live evidence; completed Tactical `154` adds
truthful publication-aware progress plus direct scoped Quick Look playback and
exact physical cleanup;
completed-file cloud export remains a separate copy/verification tactical
rather than an active torrent-root feature.
