# Client Persistence And Session Boundary

Topic: `client-persistence`

Status: Completed Tactical
[`201`](../tactical/201-durable-seeding-goals-and-seed-admission.md) advances
the disposable catalog to fresh schema 23. It adds bounded monotonic lifetime
peer-payload totals, active/finished/seeding timers, explicit-unknown tracker
counts, and the four typed global seed settings. Recognized schemas `1..=22`
reset only application-private database files and preserve external final
files and unrelated root content. One session accumulator now checkpoints
generation-fenced exact peer payload and nested monotonic activity timers in
bounded 500-row transactions, including a synchronized clean-shutdown flush;
schema 23 stores no derived rank, goal, admission, rate, or task state. Earlier
schema history below remains historical.

Completed Tactical
[`188`](../tactical/188-existing-payload-adoption-and-recheck.md) changes no
schema. It adds one transaction that converts unowned discovered storage into
the exact staging/published state while advancing `verification_requested`,
so every post-commit restart must complete checking before ordinary
fast-resume can apply. Tacticals `007` and `009` implemented the first
`rstorrent-session` application/engine boundary, instance-scoped SQLite
profile store, exact magnet metadata retention, durable have checkpoints, and
conservative restart through both path and Android SAF platform-capability
storage. Tactical `052` now batches payload synchronization and have commits
behind hash verification, and Tactical `054` retains that crash contract under
independent write/hash execution. Tactical `040` adds schema version `4`,
durable archive state, and an explicit restartable removal job spanning SQLite
and path or SAF cleanup. Tactical `061` advances the root registry to schema
version `5`; Tactical `062` advances it to version `6` with a durable verified
publication component and managed-artifact ownership.
Completed Tactical `161` changes no schema or locator representation. Its
focused test and installed Windows campaign prove that native selection reaches
this existing registry, unavailable-root repair preserves one entry, and the
same default root restores after process restart.

Completed Tactical `162` likewise changes no profile schema. It adds one
shell-owned application-config `desktop-shell.json` with a 4 KiB input bound,
atomic replacement, conservative reset, and default-on background policy.
Completed Tacticals `164` and `165` advance its closed schema through versions
2 and 3 with default-on desktop notification and active-work sleep-inhibition
preferences. Tactical
[`179`](../tactical/179-disposable-incubation-state-epoch.md) removes the
version-1 and version-2 readers: only version 3 now opens, while older,
malformed, oversized, and unknown records atomically repair to current
defaults. These shell policies apply before and across profile services; they
are not torrent state, storage locators, client settings, updater identity, or
future installation-wide `product.db` state.

Tactical `063` now makes the existing sparse file-selection rows a live
transactional control and separates paused start-content intent from metadata
acquisition without adding a second pending-torrent authority. Tactical `067`
replaces the Android product's fixed startup descriptor manifest with lazy,
bounded platform acquisition while preserving the same durable root,
selection, checkpoint, publication, repair, and removal authority. Tactical
`073` unifies BEP 3 file/tree storage and replaces claimed-bit-only restart
with an atomic all-wanted managed full recheck. Tactical `075` implements the
accepted bounded ephemeral application-state mode with private session and
metrics databases, explicit page maxima, no profile files, and unchanged
external payload-root semantics. Tactical `078` reuses the existing complete,
published, desired-running, metadata, have, and storage-root authority to
restore bounded path-backed seeding without a schema change. Tactical `081`
advances the store to schema version `8` and implements the accepted source
boundary: exact original magnet or outer-metainfo input is provenance, while
hash-authorized `raw_info`, normalized trackers and hints, and ordinary resume
state remain operational SQLite authority. Tactical `084` advances the store
to schema version `9` with one constrained typed client-settings singleton and
atomic durable full-group mutation for restart-applied listener, connection,
and upload-slot intent. Tactical `088` advances that singleton to schema
version `10` with automatic/fixed local-network listener variants and explicit
disabled-or-UPnP mapping intent. Fresh product profiles now default to an
automatic local-network listener with UPnP mapping enabled; existing stored
settings and historical migrations remain unchanged. Concrete local and
external endpoints and mapping leases remain runtime facts rather than durable
state.
Tactical `089` advances the singleton to schema version `11` with a validated
preferred listen port. Fresh and version-10 profiles default to `6881`;
actual TCP, UDP, and mapped external ports remain runtime facts. Completed
Tactical
[`097`](../tactical/097-live-client-settings-and-replaceable-session-generations.md)
keeps schema version 11 and the atomic singleton authority, commits durable
intent before asynchronous live convergence, and accepts the same mutation
for an ephemeral profile's in-memory lifetime. Effective state and mapping
cleanup remain non-durable runtime facts.
Completed Tactical
[`098`](../tactical/098-authenticated-https-tracker-platform-trust.md) advances
that singleton to schema version 12 with a closed tracker HTTPS server-
authentication policy. Fresh and every migrated profile default to
`system_trust`; explicit `disabled` survives reopen, no-op, replay, and
ordinary hidden-field saves; malformed durable values fail closed. Effective
policy and TLS outcomes remain runtime facts.

Completed Tactical
[`180`](../tactical/180-typed-settings-patches-and-draft-convergence.md) changes
no schema or durable representation. The service merges each closed typed
client or torrent settings patch with the current complete row, validates the
final candidate once, and commits the candidate, receipt, and resulting
revision under the existing transaction. Omitted fields remain untouched;
invalid combinations and injected store failure persist nothing; semantic
no-ops retain the revision; and exact replay returns the prior receipt before
runtime reconciliation.

Completed Tactical
[`105`](../tactical/105-fact-based-persistence-and-recheck-containment.md)
advances the store to schema version `14` after an observed schema-13 profile
proved that generic piece checkpoints could contradict separately persisted
storage and publication lifecycle. The torrent row now retains one closed
`payload_state`, requested/completed verification generations, and an optional
bounded quarantine reason. Runtime torrent/storage presentation is derived;
piece checkpoints mutate have evidence only. Exact read-only migration
observations recover the known `staging + published`, final-only defect as
`final_owned` and request validation without moving or rewriting payload.
Ambiguous or malformed torrent-local state is quarantined while healthy
torrents, settings, and the application service continue opening.

Completed Tactical
[`108`](../tactical/108-serialized-torrent-control-and-observable-checking.md)
retained schema-14's fact-based authority and the then-current conservative
default while decoupling selection from full-verification admission. Full-
check evidence covers every readable logical piece independently of wanted
policy;
checker phase, counters, cursor, heartbeat, and storage queues remain runtime
facts. The tactical deliberately adds no trusting resume field or heuristic,
but establishes the pure admission-policy seam now selected by planned
Tactical `120`. Force recheck remains full under the accepted future policy.

Tactical
[`111`](../tactical/111-mse-peer-stream-encryption.md)'s implemented slice
advances the client-settings singleton to schema version 15 with one checked
`encryption` value: `disabled`, `allow`, `prefer`, or `required`. Fresh and
migrated profiles default to `allow`; explicit values survive no-op, replay,
rollback, ephemeral lifetime, and reopen, while an unknown durable value fails
profile open. Encryption has its own live convergence domain, but effective
policy and negotiated peer methods remain non-durable runtime facts.

Completed Tactical
[`112`](../tactical/112-dual-stack-transport-and-ipv6-dht.md) advances the
same singleton to schema version 16 with one checked `ipv6_enabled` boolean.
Fresh and schema-15 profiles default to enabled without changing the stored
encryption value; explicit disable survives no-op, replay, forced process
restart, and reopen. Configured family intent is durable, while the selected
IPv6 address, listener and UDP endpoints, effective availability, DHT
identities/routing observations, tracker source, and active connection state
remain runtime facts. The DHT snapshot's bounded address-keyed identities and
per-family bootstrap samples retain their own version-2 blob contract.

Completed Tactical
[`116`](../tactical/116-platform-storage-coherence-and-ios-feasibility.md)
adds the prerequisite cross-platform storage-observation envelope, early
capability health, SAF published reads, and physical iOS persistence/lifecycle
evidence without changing schema 17. Portable rows retain root identity,
payload state, verification generations, and current storage generation;
platform locators and runtime health remain adapter-owned. It does not
by itself authorize a trusting resume decision; completed Tactical `120` now
owns that separate policy, while full Force recheck remains current behavior.

Completed Tactical
[`123`](../tactical/123-ios-on-device-root-persistence-and-recovery.md)
adds only a versioned probe-local iOS root record and generation-fenced
interrupted-workspace recovery. It proves stable app-owned identity without a
raw path or bookmark and deliberately leaves schema 17 unchanged. Picker-root
registration is disabled, so no File Provider locator enters product state.
Completed Tactical
[`147`](../tactical/147-ios-client-foundation-and-qualified-roots.md) keeps the
portable schema on stable root IDs while the maintained iOS adapter owns a
separate bounded registry of minimal security-scoped bookmark bytes, labels,
and generations. App Documents is resolved afresh; qualified selected roots
reopen, report per-root health, and repair without changing their opaque ID.
Completed Tactical
[`152`](../tactical/152-ios-multifile-selected-root-coordination.md) keeps that
registry and portable state unchanged while exact-file leases allow multifile
payloads to publish. A controlled physical tree survives process restart and
Force recheck before exact removal; no locator, bookmark, or resume heuristic
enters portable persistence.

Completed Tactical
[`120`](../tactical/120-per-torrent-trusting-fast-resume.md) records the now-
implemented persistence-facing decision. Ordinary eligible resumes trust the
existing synchronized per-torrent have bitmap after
bounded structural storage validation, without a clean-shutdown prerequisite,
global crash invalidation, product setting, or new observation table. A
pending verification generation and Force recheck remain full. The decision
uses existing schema-17 facts and adds no persisted heuristic or resume field.

Completed Tactical
[`124`](../tactical/124-duplex-verified-piece-upload.md) changes no schema and
adds no second durable availability authority. Verified pieces become
uploadable immediately in the running generation; after restart, only the
committed bitmap admitted by Tactical `120` or a completed check restores that
authority. Accepted fast resume also reconciles pending file promotions before
new writes, so persisted route state cannot leave wanted bytes stranded behind
a part-file route while hashing reads a different location.

Completed Tactical
[`134`](../tactical/134-hierarchical-transfer-rate-enforcement.md) advances
the store to schema version `18`. Each torrent row stores one checked upload
and download limit, and the existing atomic client-settings singleton stores
the session pair. Fresh and every migrated profile default all four values to
Unlimited. Exact finite values survive no-op, replay, ephemeral lifetime, and
reopen; malformed or out-of-range durable values fail closed. Effective
session clamps, allocator credit, waiters, counters, and application state
remain non-durable runtime facts.

The desktop updater's random application-config `cfu-id` is deliberately
installation-wide and separate from profile/session SQLite. A future
installation product-state store must adopt or explicitly migrate it; profile
creation/deletion must not silently rotate it or create a second identity.

## Scope

This topic owns durable client state, resume and restart correctness, database
portability, storage-root identity, and the boundary between the reusable
torrent engine and the first-party application service shared by platform
clients.

[`download-roots.md`](download-roots.md) owns how users acquire, default,
select, repair, and remove those roots and how the desktop, WebUI, and Android
present that behavior. This topic retains the durable identity and integrity
contracts beneath that UX.

[`product-state-and-feedback.md`](product-state-and-feedback.md) owns the
installation-wide local identity, aggregate engagement summary, prompt
campaign dispositions, and voluntary diagnostic-submission boundary above
profile-scoped torrent state.

It does not define the final product API, select a desktop or Android UI
architecture, prescribe every future schema column, or promise that the engine
will become a separately supported general-purpose library.

Payload and part-file layout remain storage concerns. This topic owns the
durable records that identify those artifacts and determine whether previously
verified content may be restored or must be checked again.

The accepted
[`bittorrent-v2-and-hybrid`](bittorrent-v2-and-hybrid.md) campaign may replace
the current v1-keyed database, have-state, part-file, and retained-source
formats together. Completed Tactical
[`143`](../tactical/143-dual-identity-and-persistence-foundation.md) made that
first replacement: a schema-19 fresh catalog, opaque owner IDs, full protocol
aliases, version-2 have and part-file identity, and a reset of recognized
schema `1..=18` profile databases. Public `0.1.x` packages are unsupported
incubation builds, so they do not require compatibility readers or migrations
solely to preserve an older preview. Every format remains versioned and
fail-closed. The reset targets only `session.db` and its SQLite sidecars;
user-selected roots, old partial artifacts, and published payload remain
untouched and are never adopted as verified state.

Tactical [`176`](../tactical/176-durable-high-file-priority.md) introduced one
additive sparse `file_priorities` table in schema 20. Only sorted High
overrides are stored; Normal remains implicit for wanted files, Skip remains
the existing binary selection authority, and a file cannot be both High and
skipped. Its schema-19-to-20 retention migration passed at implementation
time. Tactical
[`179`](../tactical/179-disposable-incubation-state-epoch.md) supersedes that
reader with a fresh schema-21 epoch containing the same current priority
table. Every recognized schema `1..=20` now takes the bounded full-catalog
reset and retains no application-owned profile state.

Completed Tactical
[`151`](../tactical/151-complete-source-pure-v2-runtime-vertical.md) reuses
schema 19 for the strict complete-source pure-v2 subset. The retained verbatim
outer source is required runtime authority because piece layers live outside
the hashed info dictionary; restart reparses it, requires the same full
32-byte identity and exact raw-info span, and reconstructs only conservative
selection, have, artifact, publication, and versioned wire state. Missing,
truncated, stale, corrupt, and interrupted-storage cases fail closed or enter
the existing repair/check path. No compatibility migration or second source
format was needed.

Completed Tactical
[`155`](../tactical/155-v2-magnet-authenticated-hash-exchange.md) keeps schema
19 and adds no sparse-hash artifact. A pure-v2 magnet stores its exact
authenticated raw info and full identity while sparse piece/leaf proofs stay
volatile. Incomplete restart withdraws candidate have until hashes are
refetched and bytes reverify; complete selected files may reconstruct their
tree locally against the durable file root. Info-only completed magnets can
therefore restore incoming metadata/hash/payload service without pretending a
complete outer source exists. No migration is needed for the disposable
incubation catalog.

Completed Tactical
[`156`](../tactical/156-hybrid-dual-swarm-runtime-closure.md) also keeps schema
19. One hybrid row stores the retained exact source/raw info and both unique
full aliases while one selection, artifact set, have bitmap, publication
lifecycle, and opaque owner survive restart. Authenticated pre-content
duplicates reconcile transactionally into the oldest owner; the loser is
cancelled and joined, and only bounded trackers and peer hints combine.
Sparse incomplete v2 hash knowledge stays volatile, so restart remains
conservative. The existing format expressed these facts without a migration
or development-data reset.

## Terms And Ownership

RSTorrent uses these terms to keep "client" from collapsing several different
responsibilities:

- The **torrent engine** owns peer protocols, metadata and piece verification,
  scheduling, torrent-coordinate storage behavior, and the state transitions
  that determine when content is verified.
- The **application service** owns the durable torrent catalog, settings,
  storage-root registry, queue and user intent, multi-torrent lifecycle,
  restart orchestration, and the application-facing command, snapshot, and
  event model.
- A **platform adapter** owns operating-system capabilities such as the
  application-data directory, Android persisted SAF grants and descriptors,
  foreground-service lifetime, notifications, and desktop integration.
- A **product client** owns presentation and user interaction. Android and
  desktop clients consume the same application service in-process.

The application service is native Rust product code. Placing SQLite there does
not move persistence into Kotlin, a desktop UI runtime, or an external daemon.

Completed desktop-notification Tactical
[`164`](../tactical/164-desktop-completion-and-attention-notifications.md)
applies that boundary without changing profile persistence: the Tauri Rust
adapter consumes authoritative in-process torrent-list state and owns native
display, while its three installation-wide preferences live only in the
bounded desktop shell settings file. Notification edges, delivery history,
and raw error text do not enter `session.db`, `product.db`, or torrent rows.
Completed sleep-inhibition Tactical
[`165`](../tactical/165-cross-platform-active-download-sleep-inhibition.md)
uses the same boundary for one version-3 power preference. The native
desktop/Android owners derive current level from authoritative operational
state; inhibitor handles, acquisition failures, and runtime lock state are
never durable profile or product facts. iOS adds no persisted power setting.

## Reference Direction

[Rasterbar libtorrent](https://libtorrent.org/manual-ref.html#fast-resume)
produces engine resume snapshots and session state but leaves their durable
storage, filenames, catalog, and migration policy to its caller. That
separation is useful, but RSTorrent does not need to reproduce libtorrent's
public C++ library surface or place orchestration in Python.

JSTorrent uses SQLite as a cross-platform key/value store containing JSON and
encoded binary state. That proves the practical desktop and Android direction,
but RSTorrent should use typed tables, transactions, constraints, and native
BLOBs rather than retain a JavaScript-shaped persistence format. JSTorrent
Desktop also isolates stable profile identities into separate directories and
databases; its additional discovery, liveness, takeover, daemon, and port
coordination shows that storage isolation is much cheaper than simultaneous
profile execution.

Current qBittorrent source provides the closest database precedent: typed
client columns coexist with opaque libtorrent metadata and resume BLOBs.
Transmission, Deluge, rTorrent, and rqbit demonstrate viable file and
whole-session snapshot designs, but also show file proliferation,
cross-file-consistency windows, or whole-catalog rewrite and recovery costs.

These references inform the design; their persistence formats are not
compatibility requirements. See [`../references.md`](../references.md) for the
reference-use policy.

## Accepted Persistence Direction

### One local SQLite authority per profile

Use one versioned SQLite database per application-service instance as the
authoritative client and session store on desktop and Android. A normal
single-profile product opens one instance and one database. The database lives
in application-private local storage. SAF locations, removable filesystems,
network shares, and cloud-synchronized payload roots are represented by
records in the database; they do not contain the live database.

Bundle one sufficiently current SQLite version with the Rust application
service so supported platforms share behavior and fixes. At the time this
topic was written, WAL-enabled builds must contain SQLite's
[2026 WAL-reset fix](https://sqlite.org/wal.html#the_wal_reset_bug). Do not
allow Android platform SQLite and bundled Rust SQLite to open the same
database independently. The initial connection policy should prefer one
identifiable Rust writer owner, bounded transactions, a busy timeout,
foreign-key enforcement, WAL with its activation verified, and
`synchronous=FULL`.

[WAL files](https://sqlite.org/wal.html#the_wal_file) are part of a live
database's persistent state. Backup, export, and migration must use
[SQLite's backup facilities](https://sqlite.org/backup.html) or a controlled
checkpoint and close; copying only the main file while the application runs is
not a valid backup.

### Ephemeral application state is explicit, not fallback

An application service may explicitly select an ephemeral mode in which the
same typed session and metrics schemas live in private, bounded SQLite
in-memory databases for one service lifetime. The mode creates no profile
directory or database auxiliary files, preserves transactions, request
idempotency and the ordinary owner/task lifecycle while open, and restores
nothing after the service shuts down, joins its owners, is dropped, and closes
its private SQLite connections. Detaching the last presentation or transport
connection does not stop the service or clear its state.

Durable persistence remains the normal desktop and Android product mode.
Failure to open, migrate, or write a durable profile must never silently fall
back to ephemeral state. The two modes are an application configuration choice,
not a corruption-recovery heuristic or a second persistence format.

The implemented bounds are 256 MiB of session main-database page space and
32 MiB of metrics main-database page space, computed from and
verified against each connection's actual page size. SQLite `FULL` is a typed
application `resource_limit`; the current session transaction rolls back,
while background metrics persistence degrades with one bounded diagnostic and
live history remains available. In-memory SQL temporary storage is forced to
memory, and `MEMORY` rollback journals preserve atomic transactions without a
filesystem journal.

Payload roots remain separate capabilities. Ephemeral application state does
not claim that a started download writes no payload, staging, or part data; a
fully memory-backed content store requires its own engine and resource design.
Tactical `081` retains an exact original source in the same private in-memory
session database, never in a temporary or payload file, so it disappears with
the rest of the ephemeral catalog. Tactical
[`075`](../tactical/075-ephemeral-application-state.md) records the implemented
page/RSS measurements, controlled loopback lifecycle, and no-file evidence;
Tactical `081` raises the main-database budget to 256 MiB. An ignored maximum
profile proves one exact 64-MiB outer source plus its nearly 64-MiB retained
info dictionary uses 134,459,392 of 268,435,456 bytes; a second distinct
maximum import returns the typed resource limit, rolls back atomically, and
leaves the first torrent, revision, and store usable. The independent 32-MiB
metrics budget is unchanged.

Completed Tactical
[`193`](../tactical/193-stateless-foreground-downloader.md) composes this mode
into one finite native downloader. Its torrent catalog, exact source, metadata,
selection, have facts, DHT snapshot, and progress history remain in these same
private databases only until joined exit; final payload stays external and a
later invocation uses the complete checker rather than a new resume format.
The small temporary lock rendezvous and invocation-owned selective part
workspace are operational filesystem resources, not a durable application
catalog. Controlled completion, cancellation, forced-death recovery, and
native desktop runs left no session database, metrics database, WAL, shared-
memory file, DHT snapshot, copied metainfo, or adjacent CLI part artifact.

### Verified metadata is durable

[BEP 9](https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0009.html) supplies only the exact
bencoded info dictionary, not the complete outer `.torrent` dictionary. After
its hash matches the requested v1 identity and it passes the normal bounded
metainfo parser, store those exact raw bytes as a BLOB in the same transaction
that advances the torrent from awaiting metadata to ready.

Store explicit source intent separately. This includes the torrent identity
and bounded user-supplied magnet fields needed to reconstruct intent, such as
tracker URLs, display name, and explicit peer hints. A user-supplied peer hint
is distinct from a reconstructible dynamic peer cache.

The raw info bytes are authoritative. Parsed columns may support queries and
presentation, but restart re-hashes and re-parses the raw bytes under current
limits before metadata-derived state becomes trusted. A later export command
may synthesize a `.torrent` outer dictionary around those authentic info bytes;
that export is not the original metainfo file unless the original file was
independently retained as source input.

Separate per-torrent metadata files are not a second authority. They may
eventually exist as explicit exports or reconstructible caches.

Schema version `8` admits exact durable `raw_info` up to 64 MiB, 2,097,152
pieces, and the corresponding compact have state. These limits are
session-owned numeric capabilities rather than consequences of a generic
bencode byte constant. Excess raw-info bytes, piece count, or encoded have
state fails as a typed internal resource limit before a write transaction;
restart reparses exact stored bytes under the durable metainfo profile.

### Accepted original-source and explicit-import boundary

Tactical `081` advances the schema so a torrent no longer requires a
magnet source. Operational state retains exact `raw_info`, normalized tracker
tiers and peer hints, and current resume intent. A separate one-source record
retains either the bounded verbatim submitted magnet or the bounded complete
outer `.torrent` bytes plus length and SHA-256. Existing rows are marked
canonicalized unless one retained successful add receipt unambiguously proves
their verbatim submission; bounded request receipts are evictable retry
infrastructure and never become source authority.

The exact outer source is a provenance/export BLOB in SQLite, not runtime
authority and not a payload-adjacent or profile sidecar file. Ordinary startup
does not use it as protocol, storage, or publication authority. Durable mode
therefore keeps one transactional backup/removal boundary; ephemeral mode gets
the same semantics in memory without a path. A later explicit export may use
those exact bytes, while a source-less export remains synthesized and must be
labeled accordingly.

Tactical `081` raises explicit `.torrent`, original-source, and durable
`raw_info` bounds to 64 MiB while independently raising
peer-controlled BEP 9 metadata to libtorrent's 30-MiB default. The larger
durable profile is required because the adopted 2,097,152-piece limit alone
permits a 40-MiB v1 piece-hash string. The tactical also raises have-state and
schema cardinalities and requires compact or paged downstream owners rather
than treating this as a parser-only constants change. These remain
context-specific hostile-input bounds, not trust in a local filename or
authenticated caller. Original-source bytes and tracker credentials remain
sensitive and are excluded from routine snapshots and logs.

Tactical
[`107`](../tactical/107-source-aware-magnet-export.md) activates the narrow
magnet half of that deferred export boundary. A magnet source is returned only
after its recorded byte length and SHA-256 match, current bounded parsing
succeeds, and its v1 identity matches the requested torrent. Valid text is not
rewritten, so verbatim additions preserve ordering, encoding, and unsupported
fields while migrated sources remain labeled canonicalized. Missing,
metainfo, or integrity-failed source records instead synthesize from durable
identity, verified publication name, and normalized trackers. The output
remains within 16 KiB and 32 trackers and reports omissions; no schema or
startup authority changes.

Completed Tactical
[`172`](../tactical/172-provisional-magnet-display-name.md) adds one narrow
startup read without changing that authority boundary. If an older
current-schema operational magnet lacks `dn`, resume may recover only the
provisional display name from its retained magnet after checking recorded
length, SHA-256, bounded current parsing, source fidelity, and exact torrent
identity. New operational magnets retain the bounded `dn` directly. The exact
source remains unchanged and the complete URI, tracker credentials, and all
other unsupported parameters remain outside routine views and logs.

### Verified-piece state is essential resume state

Persist the verified-piece bitfield as a bounded, explicitly versioned BLOB.
Its encoding defines the associated info hash, piece count, bit order, length,
and zero-padding rules. SQLite does not interpret BLOB representation, so raw
Rust struct layouts are never a persistence format.

Percent complete is derived from verified pieces, exact piece lengths, and
current selection. It is not authoritative durable state. A cached display
value may exist later, but the engine may not resume from it.

The initial durable-resume slice does not need unfinished-block maps, peer
caches, transfer history, or every libtorrent fast-resume field. Those may be
added when their owner, update frequency, bounds, and restart semantics are
defined.

### Resume is evidence, not verification

A persisted have-bit does not prove that current payload bytes are correct,
and a false bit does not prove that usable bytes are absent. The managed
restart path first validates durable identity, bitmap geometry, payload and
verification generations, root health, namespace ownership, exact logical
file kind/length observations, and part-file header/slot extents.

If those facts match for an ordinary eligible staging or published resume, the
engine installs only the existing committed true bits without reading payload
content, starting a SHA-1 job, or creating a verification generation. A false
bit remains missing work even when bytes happen to be physically present.
Clean shutdown is neither required nor recorded.

Checker-readable structural disagreement starts one full generation for that
torrent only. The existing checker removes the old runtime bitmap, hashes
every physically readable logical piece independently of selection,
synchronizes newly recovered staging targets as required, and atomically
replaces have state only after all jobs join. Unavailable roots remain awaiting
storage; malformed or ambiguous ownership remains repair-local. Explicit or
pending Force recheck always takes this complete checker path.

The critical crash-ordering invariant is one-sided: durable storage and
verification occur before the database may commit a have-bit. A crash between
verification and that database commit can create a false negative, but full
recheck now recovers valid managed bytes without requiring redownload. It must
not create a false positive that presents unverified content as complete.

### Complete path-backed torrents restore bounded seeding

Tactical `078` adds no seeding schema. While the application service is open,
the existing desired-running intent temporarily means that a complete,
published, unarchived path-backed torrent is eligible for one bounded incoming
upload peer. Application startup reparses and rehash-authorizes stored raw
info, requires exact have geometry and the recorded publication name, opens a
conservative readable-content plan, and registers the torrent with the shared
listener. Completion performs the same reconciliation after the download task
ends.

Pause, archive, file-selection change, force recheck, removal, and application
shutdown invalidate and join the exact registration before mutating durable
or storage authority. Restore, resume, or successful recheck may register a
new generation after eligibility returns. Platform-capability and descriptor
roots remain ineligible because this slice has no restartable upload read
handle contract for them.

The controlled restart proof reopens the same profile in a second process and
serves verified BEP 9 metadata plus all single- and multi-file payload bytes to
an RSTorrent magnet leecher. This proves restoration from durable complete
state, not a detached download-task continuation. Explicit seeding intent,
goals, counters, listener policy persistence, and upload limits remain later
schema/setting decisions after multi-peer accounting exists.

## Logical Architecture

The intended dependency direction is:

```text
Android UI / desktop UI / CLI
              |
      platform adapter
              |
    application service
      SQLite + lifecycle
              |
       torrent engine
              |
     protocol and domain
```

The current crates now express the initial boundary. `rstorrent-protocol` owns
pure protocol and deterministic state, `rstorrent-engine` owns Tokio
networking and storage execution, `rstorrent-session` owns SQLite and
application lifecycle, and the Android and Tauri adapters consume that
application service in-process. The older Android diagnostic path remains only
as bounded platform/storage test infrastructure.

Persistence supplies a concrete reason to introduce the application-service
boundary:

- SQLite and migrations can be tested without peer networking.
- Peer and storage behavior can be tested without a database.
- Product settings and multi-torrent queue policy do not enter peer-engine
  modules.
- Android and desktop consume one native restart policy.
- The engine does not acquire platform paths, SAF URIs, SQL rows, or UI
  lifecycle types.

The accepted first physical shape is `rstorrent-session`, depending inward on
`rstorrent-engine`. It owns the concrete SQLite implementation, semantic
application control, and engine supervision. Platform adapters depend on it.
The continuing control contract is recorded in
[`application-control.md`](application-control.md).

The name is less important than the direction. Do not create a generic
`Client` facade, persistence-backend trait hierarchy, plugin system, remote
service contract, or public compatibility promise merely to resemble
libtorrent. Start with one concrete SQLite store and plain application-service
types. A trait or further crate split must solve a demonstrated second backend,
test seam, ownership problem, or reuse requirement.

The engine should expose bounded checkpoint values and coarse verified-piece
transitions without depending on SQL. The application service may batch those
transitions into database transactions. Piece blocks and payload buffers do
not cross the application or platform boundary.

Platform-capability storage uses dynamic, bounded descriptor acquisition. When
verified metadata establishes a safe layout, the application service retains
the selected stable root identity but does not request a startup manifest
proportional to torrent file count. A shared session file pool asks the
platform adapter for one existing or newly created document on a cache miss;
Rust duplicates the returned descriptor and owns torrent-coordinate I/O,
recheck, and verified progress. The adapter owns capability resolution and
provider namespace operations. This handoff is not a portable application
command and must not expose URI or descriptor values to browser or remote
clients. The accepted Android boundary and replacement of the fixed proof
manifest are recorded in
[`android-saf-storage.md`](android-saf-storage.md).

Publication through a platform provider is also explicit and two-phase.
Engine preparation and per-file hashes become durable before the adapter
renames provider documents. The service marks a torrent complete only after
freshly reopened published descriptors match that durable manifest. This is
the platform equivalent of the path backend's atomic publication boundary and
provides a conservative restart point on either side of a provider rename.

## Profile-Ready Isolation

Multiple profiles are a potentially useful application feature, but they
should not make every torrent query and invariant multi-tenant from the start.
Preserve the option through instance and directory isolation:

```text
application data/
  product.db
  profiles/
    <stable-profile-id>/
      session.db
```

Each application-service instance receives an explicit stable profile identity
and profile root at construction, owns exactly one database beneath that root,
and owns all engine tasks restored from it. Profile display names are mutable
metadata and never directory identities. Torrent identifiers need only be
unique inside a profile; a future cross-profile surface identifies a torrent
with both profile and torrent identity.

Do not add `profile_id` to every session table. A database is already the
isolation boundary, which makes backup, deletion, migration, corruption
recovery, and tests independently scoped. It also prevents one missing SQL
predicate from exposing or mutating another profile.

The first product may expose only one automatically created profile. Preserve
future switching with these low-cost constraints:

- no process-global application service, database connection, torrent
  registry, or mutable settings singleton; a runtime may be shared only
  through an explicit higher-level owner rather than a hidden global;
- all background tasks, events, caches, and temporary state have an
  application-service instance owner;
- profile-relative state remains beneath the profile root, while payload roots
  remain explicit external capabilities;
- truly installation-wide bootstrap state, such as the profile registry and
  last-selected profile, is kept outside any one profile database; local
  identity, product summaries, and prompt dispositions use the installation-
  wide `product.db` defined by
  [`product-state-and-feedback.md`](product-state-and-feedback.md); and
- switching an exclusive active profile quiesces and joins its engine work,
  commits or conservatively abandons pending checkpoints, closes its database
  and platform capabilities, and only then opens the next instance.

Changing which profile the UI displays while previous profiles continue
downloading is simultaneous multi-profile operation, not merely quick
switching. It can use multiple application-service instances without changing
the database schema, but it creates real additional policy:

- one process-wide resource budget must bound the sum of profile activity;
- incoming listen ports, DHT identity, NAT mappings, bandwidth policy, and
  other process or network resources need explicit sharing or isolation;
- overlapping payload roots and the same torrent in multiple profiles can
  create cross-profile storage races;
- Android foreground-service, notification, and background-lifecycle
  ownership must represent every active instance; and
- deletion, takeover, and crash recovery need an authority above the
  individual profile.

Do not claim or implement simultaneous profiles in Tactical `007`. Designing
the service as an instance rather than a singleton keeps that later choice
open without paying these policy costs now.

## Schema Direction

The implemented successor is a fresh direct-storage schema, not a migration of
publication-era ownership. Tactical `191` advanced schema 21 to disposable
schema 22 and removed publication-specific state. Completed Tactical `201`
advances that shape to schema 23 with seeding settings and durable scalar
accounting. Its fixed-size write transaction accepts at most 500 unique rows,
rejects counter/timer regression and malformed timer ordering, and keeps
tracker unknown distinct from zero. Durable verified metainfo, root/selection/
run intent, verification generations, synchronized have evidence, repair
facts, and restartable exact deletion remain. Final content is recovered by
re-add and checking; unknown legacy hidden artifacts are neither adopted nor
deleted by reset.

Tactical `007` should define the first exact schema and migrations. The
continuing direction is:

- schema and migration history;
- global settings, using typed columns or narrowly scoped typed key/value
  records where flexibility is real;
- stable storage-root identities with platform-specific opaque locators and
  capability status;
- torrent identity, lifecycle, source intent, timestamps, queue order, and
  selected root;
- exact verified metainfo/info bytes;
- bounded versioned verified-piece state; and
- sparse file-selection overrides rather than an unconditional row for every
  file.

Payload files, part payload, logs, large reconstructible caches, and temporary
network data stay outside SQLite. Tracker credentials and private magnet
material are sensitive application data and must not appear in logs or
unredacted diagnostics.

Add, metadata-accepted, selection/root change, pause intent, and logical
removal transitions should be transactional inside the database. Filesystem
publication and deletion cannot share a transaction with SQLite; represent
their intermediate state explicitly and make restart cleanup idempotent.

Tactical `063` implements selection change against the existing sparse rows.
The transaction validates the complete bounded target set before changing any
row, stores only skipped overrides, and retains the request receipt at the
same revision. A no-op is replay-safe. Metadata-only add uses ordinary durable
paused intent while allowing the metadata worker to finish; restart restores
that acquisition without preparing payload storage.

Tactical `176` composes a second bounded sparse set beside those rows. One
transaction validates the complete file target, makes High/Normal wanted,
removes High when Normal or Skip is selected, and advances the revision only
when the semantic result changes. Both sparse sets retain the existing 4,096-
entry ceiling; malformed, padding, out-of-range, duplicate, and oversized
commands fail before mutation.

Tactical
[`100`](../tactical/100-bep53-select-only-and-duplicate-add-feedback.md)
generalizes that one-sided sparse representation in schema 13. File selection
is one explicit wanted-or-skipped default with bounded opposite exceptions;
the migration maps existing rows to a wanted default with skipped exceptions.
A select-only magnet retains compact pending ranges before metadata, then
resolves them to a skipped default with wanted non-padding, in-catalog
exceptions without materializing the complement. Request receipts, paged file
views, snapshots, reopen, and active-owner priority fencing preserve that
compact meaning.

Tactical `040` implements that removal boundary. A torrent row remains the
foreign-key authority while a bounded removal job records generation, data
policy, stage, and error. Startup finishes pending path work before restoring
running torrents and leaves platform work available for the Android service.
For new multi-file torrents, path cleanup derives the verified named final
directory and the full-info-hash staging and part artifacts under the
configured root. A durable path-ownership state prevents an unowned
destination that caused a collision from being deleted. Legacy schema-5 rows
retain their old hash-layout cleanup plan. Symlinks are unlinked rather than
followed, absent owned artifacts are success, and siblings and the root are
retained. SAF cleanup derives the final, staging, and part document names from
verified metadata; Kotlin owns the persisted grant and provider calls, while
Rust now also requires the durable verified name and validates the operation
generation before deleting the catalog row.

Request receipts remain durable across schema evolution. Torrent snapshots
stored before retention support replay with conservative defaults for absent
archive and managed-deletion capability fields rather than making an old
successful mutation unreadable after upgrade.

## Cross-Platform Invariants

- The database file format is portable; absolute paths and capabilities are
  not. Use storage-root identities instead of treating a path string as a
  portable key.
- The live database remains on a local filesystem with SQLite-compatible lock
  and shared-memory behavior.
- Android SAF URIs and persisted grants are platform locators, never SQLite
  file locations and never open descriptor numbers.
- iOS app-container URLs, security-scoped bookmarks, File Provider identities,
  and coordination leases are likewise platform locators/runtime
  capabilities, never portable SQLite paths or open descriptor numbers.
- Tactical
  [`123`](../tactical/123-ios-on-device-root-persistence-and-recovery.md)
  proves the historical probe-local opaque app-owned root ID and generation-
  fenced recovery. Completed Tactical `147` resolves app Documents afresh and
  keeps selected-root bookmarks in the platform registry rather than portable
  SQLite; cloud and positively identified provider roots remain disabled.
- File sizes, timestamps, sparse allocation, case sensitivity, and identity
  tokens are platform-specific restart evidence, not universal content proof.
- Within the `0.1.x` incubation line, a newer application may migrate a
  recognized older schema when useful, but has no obligation to do so. It may
  instead apply the bounded application-private reset contract. An older
  application refuses a newer unsupported schema rather than guessing or
  attempting an automatic downgrade.
- Backup and restore remap unresolved storage roots explicitly and never
  silently reinterpret a locator from another operating system.
- Corrupt or unsupported durable state cannot establish verified metadata,
  have-pieces, storage publication, or seeding eligibility.

## Known Gaps And Open Decisions

- When a future version is explicitly declared the first supported beta or
  release, freeze its fresh schema/state baseline and the forward/rollback
  policy that begins there. No migration from `0.1.x` incubation state is
  required. Prove recognized-incubation reset, interrupted reset,
  corrupt/ambiguous/busy/future state, root loss, and payload preservation.
  The disposable-state freedom ends only at that explicit support boundary;
  the release gate lives in
  [`beta-release-readiness.md`](beta-release-readiness.md).
- Backup, export, restore, and later schema policy after the accepted
  v2/hybrid clean-state reset; compatibility migration of current `0.1.x`
  incubation torrents is explicitly not required.
- The installation-level profile registry format, whether it shares
  `product.db`, and whether the first product exposes more than its
  automatically created profile.
- Whether Android places the database in backed-up or explicitly no-backup
  app-private storage.
- The bounded durability epochs from
  [`storage-throughput-architecture.md`](storage-throughput-architecture.md)
  are implemented. Tactical `054`'s strengthened 80 MiB forced-death profile
  retains exactly 256 partial claims, clears one deliberately corrupted claim
  and downloads precisely the remaining 65 pieces. Fresh exact pre-sync and
  post-sync/pre-commit crashes retain zero false have bits; the observed
  post-commit boundary safely retains all 256. Broader filesystem failure
  profiles remain open.
- Completed Tactical `120` owns the implemented per-torrent trust policy now
  that Tactical `116` makes storage generation, root health, logical artifact
  identity, and file observations coherent for path and supported Android SAF
  storage. Completed Tactical `147` applies the same conservative structure
  and Force semantics to app-owned and qualified selected iOS roots without a
  portable locator or new trust field. Tactical `120` deliberately requires no
  clean-shutdown envelope, new schema field, or persisted observation
  snapshot. Its deliberate remaining risk is same-
  length external mutation; Force is the explicit fresh-integrity path.
- How completed payload moved outside the application is deliberately
  relocated or rediscovered.
- Tactical
  [`084`](../tactical/084-persisted-client-connection-and-seeding-settings.md)
  implements a typed SQLite singleton and atomic full-group mutation for
  listener policy, explicit port-mapping policy, the ordinary global peer
  ceiling, and payload upload slots. Tactical `088` adds the version-10
  local-network and UPnP values without persisting observed interfaces,
  gateway identity, mappings, or public addresses. Completed Tactical
  [`097`](../tactical/097-live-client-settings-and-replaceable-session-generations.md)
  owns live application and desired/effective convergence for that group
  without a schema change or second persistence authority. Successful no-op
  and exact replay saves resubmit authoritative intent after persistence
  resolution so degraded runtime state can retry.
  Completed Tactical `134` adds finite session and per-torrent peer-transfer
  limits without adding durable transfer totals. Completed Tactical
  [`201`](../tactical/201-durable-seeding-goals-and-seed-admission.md) adds
  exact pinned-libtorrent payload totals, unpaused active/finished/seeding
  timers, cached swarm counts, and global seed-goal settings in fresh schema
  23. Recognized schemas 1 through 22 retain the disposable reset contract,
  and no derived rank or active/queued result becomes durable.
- JSTorrent migration is accepted as an explicit user-initiated semantic
  import into one selected backend, not in-place reuse of the legacy database
  or live synchronization between backends. The exact supported source
  versions and imported fields remain open; legacy progress is rechecked
  before it can establish verified content. The product and UX direction lives
  in [`product-surfaces-and-migration.md`](product-surfaces-and-migration.md).
- How storage roots are remapped or replaced across platform backup/restore
  when an opaque locator or grant is not transferable.
- User-selected first-root, default-root, per-add, repair, and macOS
  platform-picker behavior plus recognizable multi-file publication are
  implemented by Tacticals `061` and `062`. Linux and Windows picker adapters
  and general Android multi-root presentation remain open.

## Implemented Evidence

[`../tactical/007-durable-session-control.md`](../tactical/007-durable-session-control.md)
completed the smallest persistence and restart slice:

- `rstorrent-session` owns `session.db`, schema versioning, configured
  path-root identities, the torrent catalog, sparse selection rows, raw info
  BLOBs, versioned have BLOBs, and bounded request receipts.
- Bundled `rusqlite 0.40.1` uses `libsqlite3-sys 0.38.1` and SQLite `3.53.2`.
  WAL, foreign keys, `synchronous=FULL`, and the busy timeout are set and
  checked at open. Both initial Android Rust targets cross-compiled this
  bundled implementation.
- The engine synchronizes each verified piece before the service commits its
  have bit. Restart rehashes claimed pieces through the existing 16 KiB
  buffer, clears same-length corruption, skips a remaining valid claim, and
  reopens either staging or published path storage.
- Three libtorrent runs killed the process after two of three pieces, retained
  the exact 26,686-byte BEP 9 info dictionary, deliberately corrupted one
  staged claim, observed recheck reduce `2` claims to `1`, uploaded only the
  remaining 23,616 payload bytes, and published the expected SHA-1. A second
  restart rechecked the completed tree with the seed removed.
- Corrupt metadata, malformed have padding, incomplete storage artifacts, and
  a corrupt SQLite file have explicit fail-closed and preservation tests.

[`../tactical/009-android-saf-session-storage.md`](../tactical/009-android-saf-session-storage.md)
extends that evidence to Android platform-capability storage:

- stable root IDs remain in SQLite while persisted tree URIs stay in
  app-private Android state and descriptor numbers remain ephemeral;
- descriptor-backed resume validates exact manifests and part identity,
  rehashes claimed pieces with a fixed 16 KiB buffer, and commits only synced
  verified content;
- durable prepared-file hashes and explicit `prepared` /
  `awaiting_publication` phases separate native completion from provider
  rename and fresh-descriptor confirmation;
- AVD and Pixel runs recovered from process death during download and again
  after provider rename but before SQLite completion; and
- a deliberately revoked persisted grant restarted fail-closed without
  discarding the stable platform identity.

[`../tactical/062-user-visible-publication-layout.md`](../tactical/062-user-visible-publication-layout.md)
adds schema version `6`, atomically retains the verified multi-file
publication component, and separates recognizable final ownership from
full-info-hash staging/part ownership. Path create/resume, Files projection,
collision handling, restart, and managed removal now share that durable plan;
schema-5 hash-layout rows fail closed for resume and remain explicitly
removable without automatic relocation.

[`../tactical/063-live-file-selection.md`](../tactical/063-live-file-selection.md)
adds durable bounded `Normal`/`Skip` mutation without a schema change. Store
and application evidence covers sparse restoration, receipt replay, invalid
and padding indices, all-skipped idle state, joined generation replacement,
and metadata-only restart with no content artifact.

[`../tactical/073-unified-storage-and-complete-recheck.md`](../tactical/073-unified-storage-and-complete-recheck.md)
removes the specialized single-file resume path without adding a schema or
resume file. Schema 6's `prepared` storage state plus its one-owner managed
artifact state now also records path publication intent. `length`, one-entry
`files`, and cross-file fixtures use one engine owner and SQLite bitmap.
Restart and force recheck replace have state from all wanted piece hashes;
valid unclaimed data is recovered, stale claims are cleared, complete content
is rechecked before exposure, and paused corruption starts no network repair.
Path publication uses durable intent, atomic no-replace rename, containing-
directory sync, and a final complete transaction. Dynamic provider
confirmation enters durable `published/checking` and fresh published handles
must complete that same piece check before completion.

[`../tactical/078-local-single-peer-tcp-seeding.md`](../tactical/078-local-single-peer-tcp-seeding.md)
registers only exact complete and published path-backed rows, retains seeding
after download-task completion, restores it after application restart, and
generation-fences pause, archive, recheck, selection, removal, and shutdown.
Application and controlled process evidence verifies exact payload across
restart without adding a schema, platform read path, or detached service.

[`../tactical/084-persisted-client-connection-and-seeding-settings.md`](../tactical/084-persisted-client-connection-and-seeding-settings.md)
adds schema version `9`, migrates older profiles to disabled/200/eight, and
fails closed on missing or malformed typed rows. Full-group validation,
revision, no-op, replay, conflict, stale request, SQLite rollback, ephemeral
rejection, reopen, and configured-versus-active evidence pass. A temporary
durable profile preserves automatic/37/one through ordinary gateway shutdown
and reopen, then seeds verified content before a second fixed-bind failure and
command-path repair cycle.

[`../tactical/088-upnp-mapped-external-tcp-seeding.md`](../tactical/088-upnp-mapped-external-tcp-seeding.md)
adds schema version `10`, closed local-network listener variants, and explicit
disabled-or-UPnP intent to the same atomic group. Version-9 and older profiles
migrate to mapping disabled. Constraint, corrupt-row, no-op, replay, restart,
generated-contract, and browser-setting evidence pass; observed endpoints,
leases, gateway state, and diagnostics remain deliberately ephemeral.

[`../tactical/098-authenticated-https-tracker-platform-trust.md`](../tactical/098-authenticated-https-tracker-platform-trust.md)
adds schema version `12` without a second settings table or command. Migration
from all prior schemas inserts `system_trust`; SQLite constraints and typed
decode reject unknown values; the complete-group transaction retains
revision, receipt, conflict, rollback, durable reopen, and ephemeral-lifetime
semantics. A generated typed consumer can select `disabled`, while the
ordinary React settings draft preserves that hidden authoritative field when
saving visible connection or seeding values.

[`../tactical/111-mse-peer-stream-encryption.md`](../tactical/111-mse-peer-stream-encryption.md)
adds schema version `15` to the same settings row and command. Migration and
fresh DDL carry the identical closed-value check; typed decode independently
rejects corrupt values. Live `A -> B -> A` replacement is generation-fenced,
an in-flight handshake retains its captured policy, and no listener or torrent
restart is needed. Generated TypeScript, JSON Schema, UniFFI, and Kotlin
consumers plus the shared React control and physical product profile pass.

[`../tactical/112-dual-stack-transport-and-ipv6-dht.md`](../tactical/112-dual-stack-transport-and-ipv6-dht.md)
adds schema version `16` to that row and command. Exact fresh, migration,
constraint, corrupt-row, receipt replay, no-op, rollback, ephemeral-lifetime,
and durable reopen tests pass. A live enable-disable-enable cycle is
generation-fenced, including connection cancellation before `Applied`. An API
34 arm64 AVD observed the default, applied disable, forced-restart persistence,
and expected degraded re-enable when no eligible global-unicast address was
available. The named API 37 Pixel 7a repeated those exact policy and restart
assertions on its current no-eligible-address network. Neither environment
observation rewrites configured intent.

Completed Tactical
[`114`](../tactical/114-session-wide-concurrent-torrent-admission.md) adds
schema version `17`. One `active_downloads` value defaults to three and one
nullable unique sortable queue position records automatic incomplete-download
order without persisting derived active state. Version-16 migration assigns a
stable order transactionally; pause retains position, completion removes it,
Resume appends only when absent, and `Download now` plus top/bottom movement
use the ordinary revision and receipt rules. Reopen, rollback, near-overflow
renumbering, and a 1,000-entry/2,000-move reference model all preserve one
total order. Runtime admission is reconstructed from these durable facts.

Completed Tactical
[`120`](../tactical/120-per-torrent-trusting-fast-resume.md) keeps schema 17
and makes existing synchronized have state the only positive resume authority.
One task-free typed policy combines ordinary-versus-Full intent with common
path/SAF structural observations. Its crash matrix retains zero bits before
the SQLite boundary and all 256 bits after it; physically valid false bits are
safe redownload work. Five hundred completed seeds restore at verification
generation zero beside three active downloads, while an interrupted Force
generation resumes as a complete check. Matching same-length mutation is
deliberately outside ordinary detection and is caught by explicit Force.

This evidence does not broaden into a stable public wire protocol, complete UI
settings catalog, remote listener,
profile-management UI, simultaneous profiles, unfinished-block resume, or
external-mutation detection during ordinary trusting resume.
