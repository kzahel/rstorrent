# Application Control

Topic: `application-control`

Status: Tactical `007` implemented the first transport-neutral semantic
control contract and in-process application service. Tactical `008` added
recoverable reactive views and browser, Tauri, and Android adapters. Tactical
`012` added bounded typed diagnostics, derived progress assessment, and prompt
task-terminal supervision with isolated headless presentation evidence.
Tactical `013` added explicit application network configuration and a blocked
offline prerequisite without changing durable torrent intent. Tactical `033`
implemented the leased application-view owner, generated v1 JSON contract,
authenticated loopback polling adapter, and headless lifecycle client recorded
in [`application-view-api.md`](application-view-api.md). Tactical `040` adds
durable archive/restore and fenced removal with explicit keep-data or
delete-managed policy. Tactical `046` makes a successful pause receipt follow
the joined metadata/content supervisor result and its final empty peer
observation. Tactical `048` adapts the same commands and leased view sets to
the in-process Tauri product without introducing a local server. The live web
adapter now gives each application instance a random request-ID namespace so
durable receipts do not conflict across reloads or tabs. Tactical `060`
carries the same typed calls over one bounded loopback WebSocket without making
connection correlation the owner of durable request identity. No stable public
remote wire format is accepted. Tactical `049` evolves diagnostics into
hierarchical structured records with explicit capture interest and distinct
source, delivery, and local loss while keeping them separate from commands and
product-state authority. Tactical `063` adds metadata-only magnet intent and
durable live `Normal`/`Skip` file selection through the same semantic command
boundary.
Tactical `073` adds `force_recheck` as a semantic durable command with the
same expected-revision and request-receipt rules. It joins an active matching
generation, preserves durable run intent, and starts the common managed-
storage check without exposing paths, handles, or engine tasks.
Completed Tactical
[`108`](../tactical/108-serialized-torrent-control-and-observable-checking.md)
supersedes the coarse runtime boundary chosen by Tactical `063` without
rewriting its completed record. One serialized torrent controller reconciles
durable run, selection, and verification intent; one bounded
storage fence owns priority routing; and selection changes during a
selection-independent check coalesce without replacing the complete content
generation. Pause drains and retains an active checker generation and cursor,
while resume releases the same owner. Completed Tactical
[`110`](../tactical/110-atomic-download-now.md) adds exactly that semantic
command: bounded file indices become wanted and durable run intent becomes
running in one transaction and profile revision. The existing controller
reconciles current durable intent after commit or replay, retains a healthy
peer or checker generation where possible, and rejects a different busy
torrent before durable mutation. Clients do not compose priority and Resume
commands or inspect checker phase.
Completed Tactical
[`114`](../tactical/114-session-wide-concurrent-torrent-admission.md) removes
that different-torrent busy boundary. Resume durably enters one automatic
download queue, `Download now` atomically moves the torrent to its head, and
top/bottom commands mutate only durable order. One application-generation
admission owner reconciles an active-generation map under configured/effective
limits; command success remains durable intent, while queued, active,
checking, stopping, seeding, paused, and error are authoritative operational
state rather than client inference.
Tactical `075` keeps that semantic contract and its request receipts intact in
an explicitly selected, private, bounded in-memory application-state mode.
SQLite `FULL` now has the typed `resource_limit` response classification in
both persistence modes. Tactical `081` adds one byte-bearing v1 metainfo
operation beside the JSON command union: source length and SHA-256 join
semantic request identity, while WebSocket, HTTP, and Tauri adapters carry the
bytes without paths or base64. Exact duplicate replay, stale-revision
rejection, rollback and source-conflict behavior share the existing command
semantics. Tactical `083` removes SHA-256 from the caller declaration: Rust
derives it from the received bytes and reconstructs the same legacy receipt
fingerprint, so existing exact replays and different-byte conflicts remain
unchanged while browser intake needs no source hashing or secure context.
Tactical `084` adds one atomic typed `set_client_settings` command through the
same generic HTTP, WebSocket, Tauri, and UniFFI dispatch. Durable configured
intent changes immediately.
Tactical `088` extends that same closed command group with local-network
listener and explicit UPnP mapping intent. The existing torrent-list summary
projects disabled, ineligible, discovering, mapping, mapped,
renewal-failed/failed, and stopping runtime state; gateway work and mapped
addresses do not become commands or durable authority.
Completed Tactical
[`097`](../tactical/097-live-client-settings-and-replaceable-session-generations.md)
keeps the command and persistence waist but replaces restart application with
one asynchronous desired-to-effective reconciliation owner. Successful no-op
and replayed saves can retry degraded runtime convergence without inventing a
second command or settings route. Persistence resolves before submission;
ephemeral profiles retain the same intent in memory. The response and view
carry configured intent, effective values, and independent
applying/applied/degraded domains while stable peers, DHT, discovery, and
accounting survive transport handover.
Tactical `085` adds the minimal projected `force_recheck_available` capability
and composes existing per-torrent commands sequentially in the React action
owner. It does not add a batch command, atomic multi-torrent semantics, or a
new application task owner. Tactical `095` adds no command: the existing
paged tracker view now projects plaintext HTTP versus encrypted-but-
unauthenticated HTTPS, while the application composes the same long-lived
discovery owner for every supported tracker transport.
Completed Tactical
[`098`](../tactical/098-authenticated-https-tracker-platform-trust.md) extends
the same complete `set_client_settings` value with tracker HTTPS server
authentication. It adds no tracker route or mutation task: persistence still
resolves first, Tactical `097`'s one reconciler applies the domain, and typed
responses/views distinguish configured intent, optional effective policy,
degraded construction, and operation-captured tracker security.

Completed Tactical
[`134`](../tactical/134-hierarchical-transfer-rate-enforcement.md) adds
semantic Unlimited-or-bounded upload and download policy at the session and
torrent levels. The existing whole-group `set_client_settings` command owns
the session pair, while one `set_torrent_transfer_limits` command commits the
torrent pair atomically under the same durable revision, request-receipt,
replay, stale-revision, rollback, and convergence rules. Runtime application
updates one stable session bandwidth owner without replacing peer, discovery,
listener, or torrent generations.

Completed Tactical
[`138`](../tactical/138-verified-http-file-serving.md) adds the read-only
`create_media_url` semantic call for one torrent identity and file index. It
authoritatively rechecks typed eligibility, creates or reuses one volatile
file capability, and returns the complete ephemeral URL with idle and
absolute lifetime metadata. It is not a durable command, request envelope,
receipt, event, lifecycle mutation, or storage-path grant; reading it does not
start, resume, unskip, prioritize, repair, or recheck content.

## Scope

This topic owns the application-facing command, response, snapshot, and event
model above the torrent engine. It also owns the boundary between those
semantics and transports such as an in-process UI adapter, a diagnostic
process stream, or a future authenticated remote connection.

It does not authorize a daemon, listener, relay, account system, remote
authentication design, or payload traffic across the control boundary.

## Direction

Android, desktop, CLI, and application-level integration tests should drive
the same application service through the same typed semantic contract. The
local product still runs that service and the engine in-process. Sharing
semantics does not require local networking or serialization.

The initial contract has:

- a versioned request envelope with a caller-supplied request identity;
- an optional expected revision for rejecting stale mutations;
- typed commands referring to torrent and storage-root identities rather than
  sockets, file descriptors, paths, or platform objects;
- a correlated typed success or structured error response;
- monotonically increasing service revisions and complete bounded snapshots;
  and
- idempotent desired-state operations or persistent request deduplication
  where retrying a command could otherwise duplicate durable intent.

Commands express application intent. The application service translates that
intent into durable state and engine lifecycle operations. Peer messages,
piece buffers, SQL rows, logs, and task handles are not part of the contract.
Structured observability remains separate from command responses and product
state.

A bounded byte attachment may accompany a closed semantic operation when the
intent itself is binary, as for `.torrent` intake. The request still
owns version, request ID, optional expected revision, established storage-root
identity, start intent, selection, and exact source length. Common Rust
preparation derives the exact-source digest before persistence. Durable
receipt replay compares that server-derived digest and normalized options
rather than storing bytes in JSON. Adapters may frame or carry the attachment
differently, but no adapter gains alternate mutation, duplicate, revision, or
storage policy.
Tactical `081` bounds this attachment at 64 MiB, admits one at a time per host,
and replaces per-file index enumeration with canonical
all/none/range intent plus later paged mutations so the command envelope stays
within 64 KiB at the accepted file cardinality.

Application views may expose a derived progress assessment without promoting
it to a second durable state machine. The assessment distinguishes an active
owner, an automatic mechanism or scheduled retry that is still waiting,
external blockage where no installed mechanism can advance, and deliberately
inactive torrents. Failure or exhaustion of one tracker, peer, or discovery
mechanism is not itself a torrent error and is not blockage while another
automatic mechanism can still act.

Application network permission remains separate from each torrent's desired
running or paused state. An offline policy prevents DNS and socket work and
reports `network_disabled` with an `enable_network` action; it does not turn
the torrent into an error or durable pause. Future Android connectivity,
metered-network, and VPN settings should combine platform facts and user
preferences in an application-level owner, then change the engine permission
without rewriting torrent intent.

Typed diagnostics use a separate bounded reactive projection. They may explain
the facts behind a progress assessment, but clients do not parse diagnostic
text to determine torrent state, available actions, or correctness. A view
begins from bounded recent history, filters capture before its transport
queue, detects overflow or sequence loss, and can resynchronize independently
from product-state views. Hierarchical categories and typed subjects/fields
are deliberately projected application semantics rather than arbitrary Rust
debug values.

Detailed clients aggregate their currently relevant named projections into a
leased view set. One view set owns an epoch, opaque cursor, bounded diff
accumulator, and independent recovery state. Periodic pull and later streaming
drain the same semantic update batches; transport authentication and wire
encoding remain adapters. View-set identifiers are resource locators, not
authentication credentials or durable application state.

Storage roots and platform capabilities are installed when an application
service instance is constructed or through a later platform-specific
capability operation. A remotely meaningful command selects an established
root identity; it never supplies an ambient local path or open descriptor. The
accepted first-add, default-root, local picker, and remote-presentation behavior
is recorded in [`download-roots.md`](download-roots.md).

Tactical `062` keeps publication naming behind this boundary. Verified
metainfo and the selected root resolve a durable relative publication
component inside the application/engine layers; no presentation command gains
a local path, proposed filename, or infohash-layout switch.

Tactical `063` keeps file selection semantic as well. The command carries a
bounds-checked torrent identity, file indices, and `Normal` or `Skip`; it does
not expose numeric engine priorities, storage paths, part slots, or picker
internals. Selection commits before the active immutable engine generation is
cancelled and joined. Metadata acquisition may continue for a paused
start-content intent, but content storage remains unopened until explicit
resume.

An opt-in official Ubuntu smoke on 2026-08-06 exposed a gap in that accepted
policy: a fresh metadata-only magnet started its external metadata owner but
left both session-owned HTTPS tracker rows inactive for 180 seconds because
their registration inherited the false content-running intent. Tactical `096`
repairs the boundary by combining durable content intent with the presence of
the actually owned metadata task only during discovery reconciliation. A
controlled tracker-only case and the repeated Ubuntu smoke prove activation,
terminal stopped announces, paused final state, and no payload artifacts.

Force recheck is likewise semantic. A replayed successful request cannot
start another generation, and a stale request mutates neither runtime nor
durable state. During checking, presentation exposes no old verified total as
current authority. Valid paused content may return to complete; invalid paused
content retains its exact replacement bitmap without admitting peer repair,
while running intent downloads only the missing or corrupt wanted pieces.
Completed Tactical
[`105`](../tactical/105-fact-based-persistence-and-recheck-containment.md)
corrects an observed Tactical `073` restart defect at this semantic boundary.
Force recheck first fences discovery and incoming activity and joins the
active content generation, then persists one restartable verification
generation. Its checkpoint sink admits only that generation, completion
atomically replaces evidence only for the matching request, and a stale
completion cannot satisfy newer work. Checking remains runtime-derived and
the separately retained user intent decides paused or running re-entry. A
malformed torrent is quarantined rather than preventing profile open.
Android application request IDs now include a process-random namespace before
their monotonic suffix, matching the browser contract and preventing a
restarted process from reusing `android-1` for different durable intent.
The torrent application view now also projects whether current durable managed
content can accept Force recheck. Presentation uses that semantic value only
to derive exact-selection availability; dispatch and durable request handling
remain authoritative if state races after activation.

Authorization is transport context, not a user-supplied command field. A
future remote transport must authenticate a principal, attach verified
capabilities to dispatch, apply replay and rate limits, and redact sensitive
source data. The application service must not trust an `is_admin`-style value
inside an envelope.

## Compatibility Posture

The Rust semantic types may evolve while there is only an in-process client
and repository diagnostic. Serialization used by tests is a versioned
diagnostic encoding, not yet a public compatibility promise.

A future remote protocol should adapt to the semantic dispatcher rather than
becoming the owner of torrent state. The initial internal v1 shape, generated
TypeScript and JSON Schema, additive compatibility rules, and polling-to-stream
delivery model are recorded in
[`application-view-api.md`](application-view-api.md). Production
authentication, discovery, wake-up relay, and exposure policy still require a
separate threat model.

Successful commands should evolve toward command-specific results plus the
resulting durable revision rather than returning a complete service snapshot
after every mutation. Views remain the authoritative state-recovery path.
This change is internal while no stable public wire promise exists and must be
made with reducer and retry evidence rather than as an incidental transport
optimization.

Tactical
[`100`](../tactical/100-bep53-select-only-and-duplicate-add-feedback.md) makes
the add paths the first concrete use of that direction. Magnet and metainfo
adds return the affected torrent identity and distinguish `added`,
`already_present`, and BEP 53 `selection_expanded` outcomes with the resulting
revision. A plain duplicate is a successful no-op rather than a generic merge;
only an explicit `so` selection may promote skipped files. Exact request replay
returns the stored result without reapplying the transition, and adapters do
not infer duplicate state from messages or snapshot differences.

Tactical
[`107`](../tactical/107-source-aware-magnet-export.md) adds the first explicit
source export as a semantic non-mutation. `export_magnet` validates one torrent
identity and returns a typed magnet, exact/canonicalized/synthesized provenance,
and an omitted-tracker count at the current revision. It creates no receipt,
revision, task, or diagnostic and does not expose source text through routine
snapshots. Unknown identity uses the existing `unknown_torrent` error.

## Invariants

- Every mutation has one application-service instance and one session
  database as its authority, either its durable profile database or its
  private ephemeral database.
- Request correlation survives asynchronous execution and retry.
- A rejected stale revision cannot partially change durable or engine state.
- Snapshots are coherent at one service revision; events may later optimize
  updates but cannot be the only recovery mechanism.
- Local and diagnostic callers do not gain alternate privileged code paths.
- Shutdown, pause, profile close, and task failure have observable terminal
  states and joined owners.
- A task terminal result is observed without requiring a later client command.
- Blocked progress is asserted only when no installed or scheduled automatic
  mechanism can provide the next prerequisite.
- Temporary application network restriction does not rewrite a torrent's
  desired running or paused state.
- User-controlled magnets, paths, peer hints, and errors are bounded and are
  not emitted unredacted as routine logs.

## Implemented Thread And Gaps

[`../tactical/007-durable-session-control.md`](../tactical/007-durable-session-control.md)
implemented the first envelope and in-process dispatcher alongside durable
magnet resume. The Rust dispatcher and newline-delimited JSON diagnostic use
the same request and response types. Unit and forced-process-death evidence
cover request correlation, persistent duplicate replay, request-ID conflict,
stale revision rejection, coherent snapshots, pause/join, shutdown/join, and
restart through the same commands.

The diagnostic encoding remains repository test infrastructure. Tactical
`008` moved the new Android product path and Tauri shell onto the application
service and adapted the same semantic contract to a bounded loopback WebSocket
gateway. Generated TypeScript and Kotlin values, independent reactive
subscriptions, explicit resynchronization, and controlled real downloads now
provide cross-client executable evidence.

Tactical `037` routes the new React toolbar's bounded magnet intent through
that generated `add_magnet` contract. Input convenience checks improve local
feedback, but the application service remains authoritative for syntax,
resource bounds, durable duplicate handling, storage policy, and busy state.
Remote `.torrent` URL fetching remains absent rather than being represented as
a successful magnet add. Tactical `081` adds the separate file-byte operation;
Tactical `083` exposes it through the shared React empty-Add file chooser for
ordinary browser and Tauri use. The UI retains only the browser `File` while
root/start options are pending, then sends one bounded `ArrayBuffer` with
initial selection `all`.

Tactical `040` makes archive orthogonal to running intent and gives removal a
durable generation. The application service first persists paused removal
intent, joins any active torrent owner, and then either retains payload,
deletes exact path-backed managed artifacts, or waits for a trusted platform
adapter. Failed cleanup stays visible and can be retried with either retention
policy. Android SAF plans and confirmations are in-process operations keyed by
the matching generation; browser commands never carry paths or document URIs.

Tactical `046` corrects the ordinary pause join beneath that application
contract. The application still persists paused intent first, requests safe
cancellation, and awaits the active task. Engine wrappers no longer race and
drop the metadata/content supervisor; the supervisor publishes disconnecting
and final removal observations after joining child owners. A deterministic
session test proves the pause response follows TCP close, and the same leased
view set receives the peer removal plus zero active-peer and payload-rate
summary fields without another command or a presentation-side clear. A
terminal owner-cleanup failure is recorded and propagated through pause rather
than being accepted as successful joined cleanup.

The live web adapter gives every application instance a random 128-bit request
namespace followed by a monotonic sequence. This preserves durable retry and
correlation semantics without reusing `web-1` for an unrelated command after a
reload or in another tab.

Tactical `063` historically implemented live path-backed file selection as a
deliberately coarse control fence. Tactical `108` retains its atomic durable
validation but replaces matching active-generation cancellation with one
latest-value selection revision, a drained storage-route epoch transition,
and in-place picker replacement. Existing peer connections and verified
evidence survive when the route preserves bytes; an unavailable promoted part
span clears only its affected pieces before repair admission. All-skipped
content becomes idle without losing running intent, and a later promotion is
runnable without a selection-triggered full-check request. Dynamic fixed-
descriptor selection remains deliberately fail-closed.

Tactical `085` deliberately keeps multi-target orchestration above this
boundary. The React owner snapshots materialized torrent order and sends one
fresh ordinary request at a time, continues after per-target failure, and
bounds presentation diagnostics. Multi-remove similarly confirms one policy
but dispatches durable removals individually, so it promises neither atomicity
nor rollback of an earlier successful deletion.

Tactical `088` extends the existing client-settings command rather than
adding a gateway command surface. Restart applies the local-network listener
and mapping policy, while the current generation publishes mapping progress
through the existing view owner. Mapping failure is recoverable application
state and a structured diagnostic; it neither rewrites durable intent nor
stops the local listener.

Tactical `095` keeps HTTP and HTTPS below this semantic boundary. The
application retains tracker URL, tier, source, lifecycle, redaction, and the
closed `TrackerSecurityView`; reqwest clients, DNS, redirects, TLS, gzip, and
response parsing remain engine-owned infrastructure. Tactical `098` expands
that value to `unencrypted`, `encrypted_system_trust`, and
`encrypted_unauthenticated`, and extends the existing complete settings
command with a default-secure policy plus one advanced compatibility value.
It adds no certificate route, tracker credential command, environment
side-channel, or presentation-owned success rule.

The application-owned content supervisor also retains a cancellation-owned
external discovery sender from metadata transition through content startup.
That small lifecycle fence prevents a temporarily empty session tracker stream
from terminating content discovery before a late HTTP/HTTPS observation. Hash-
verified HTTP and HTTPS only-`peers6` application transfers, shutdown stopped
events, generated web validation, Android cross-builds, and an owned AVD HTTPS
run cover the boundary. The authenticated follow-up additionally passes exact
controlled pinned-libtorrent application transfer, live policy replacement,
desktop platform trust, and Android product-verifier evidence through those
same owners.

Later work must define stable product error taxonomy, capability installation,
production remote
authentication and relay semantics, and compatibility rules for any
published wire protocol.

[`../tactical/012-bounded-diagnostics-progress.md`](../tactical/012-bounded-diagnostics-progress.md)
records the completed application-control slice. It corrects command-driven
task-completion polling, adds a derived progress assessment, and carries typed
bounded diagnostics through generated browser/Tauri and Android contracts
without treating the diagnostic WebSocket gateway as a product daemon.

[`../tactical/013-explicit-live-network-policy.md`](../tactical/013-explicit-live-network-policy.md)
records explicit offline, loopback-only, and online engine policy selection.
The current application configuration is immutable for the service lifetime.
Completed Tactical
[`094`](../tactical/094-bounded-bep11-peer-exchange.md) reuses that policy for
PEX address admission and dialing, adds no application setting, and keeps PEX
disabled until verified metadata establishes a public torrent. PEX failures
remain typed protocol failures on Android; the slice adds no command, durable
preference, or generated application contract.
Tactical
[`084`](../tactical/084-persisted-client-connection-and-seeding-settings.md)
adds an atomic durable client-settings replacement while deliberately keeping
listener, global peer-limit, and upload-slot enforcement restart-applied in
that slice. Completed Tactical
[`097`](../tactical/097-live-client-settings-and-replaceable-session-generations.md)
settles the live-control boundary with independent
applying/applied/degraded domains, stable peers and discovery, replaceable
transport generations, deterministic peer eviction, and immediate slot
regrant. Android network binding and VPN leak prevention require separate
platform evidence.

The original production browser/gateway proof saves automatic/37/one, joins
and reopens onto those owners, seeds verified content, then saves a held fixed
port and repairs its typed bind failure through this same command path.
Tactical `097` adds controlled in-process live handover and degraded-retry
evidence; no settings route, adapter-specific mutation, or command-owned
background task was added.

[`../tactical/075-ephemeral-application-state.md`](../tactical/075-ephemeral-application-state.md)
adds an immutable persistence-mode choice at the same service-lifetime
boundary. Presentation and transport detachment do not close or clear an
ephemeral service; joined service shutdown remains the owner of final DHT and
speed-history flushes. Durable open or write failure never falls back to the
ephemeral mode.

[`../tactical/018-inspectable-metadata-acquisition.md`](../tactical/018-inspectable-metadata-acquisition.md)
adds a coherent read-only engine diagnostic snapshot through `DownloadControl`.
It contains the bounded peer registry and active/recent BEP 9 attempts needed
by headless investigations. It is not yet projected into the application
snapshot, generated web/Kotlin contracts, or product UI; that later projection
should select stable fields rather than expose engine internals accidentally.

The implemented subscription and client direction is recorded in
[`client-surfaces.md`](client-surfaces.md) and
[`../tactical/008-reactive-multi-surface-control.md`](../tactical/008-reactive-multi-surface-control.md).
Coherent snapshots remain recovery authority above typed patches and
independent bounded subscriber state. The WebSocket adapter is not the
application authority, and local Tauri control does not use networking.
Tactical `033` aggregates those subscriptions behind one leased view set and
preserves the same recovery invariant through authenticated polling. Tactical
`048` implements streaming as an interchangeable Tauri delivery adapter with
explicit post-application acknowledgements; browser WebSocket streaming
remains deferred.
