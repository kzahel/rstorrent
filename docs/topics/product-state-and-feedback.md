# Installation Product State And Feedback

Topic: `product-state-and-feedback`

Status: Direction accepted on 2026-08-03 and refined by explicit user
direction on 2026-09-01. Installation-wide identity, coarse engagement
counters, campaign-specific prompt state, and disclosed feedback/update/
uninstall context belong together in a product-state boundary above any one
profile. RSTorrent is intended to preserve this useful JSTorrent product
behavior while replacing its technical implementation. It is not required to
discard the behavior merely because the engine and state owners are new.
No product-state store, prompt campaign, or general analytics service is
implemented yet. Ready Tactical
[`208`](../tactical/208-installation-metrics-and-feedback-parity.md) owns the
first bounded implementation. Completed Tactical
[`206`](../tactical/206-android-jstorrent-feedback-handoff.md) adds the one
narrow Android-only external feedback navigation described below. It creates
no product-state owner. The desktop updater now
creates one random UUID in the application-config `cfu-id` file through
bounded atomic create/repair, sends it only as the `desktop-update-v1`
`X-CFU-Id` header, and discloses that use in About & updates. It is resettable
installation counting, not analytics identity or authorization. The eventual
installation-wide `product.db` must adopt or explicitly migrate this value
rather than creating a second identity. Tactical `162`'s versioned
`desktop-shell.json` is a separate shell policy whose version 1 contains only
**Run in Background**.
Completed desktop-notification Tactical
[`164`](../tactical/164-desktop-completion-and-attention-notifications.md) adds
an explicit version-2 migration that preserves that value while adding only
installation-wide desktop completion, attention, and focused-window
preferences. Those shell preferences do not widen the updater identifier or
preempt the accepted product-state database. Completed Tactical
[`165`](../tactical/165-cross-platform-active-download-sleep-inhibition.md)
advances the closed shell record to version 3 with one default-on desktop
power preference. The setting is installation-wide policy; live inhibitor
state remains derived and is never retained as product history.

## Scope

This topic owns:

- installation-wide local identity and first-run age;
- small monotonic product-usage counters useful for support context and local
  engagement decisions;
- durable state for a concrete review, feedback, migration, or companion-
  installation prompt once that prompt is designed;
- sparse installation lifecycle and version facts; and
- the privacy and consent boundary for including local context in update
  counting, feedback, bug reports, and the browser-extension uninstall survey.

[`client-persistence.md`](client-persistence.md) owns the correctness-critical
profile database and torrent restart state. Tactical
[`066`](../tactical/066-smooth-session-speed-history.md) owns transfer-rate
sampling and history. Those stores have different scope, write cadence,
retention, and failure consequences from the product facts here.

This topic does not authorize continuous analytics upload, a telemetry vendor,
an arbitrary event API, a generic prompt framework, or collection of torrent
names, hashes, paths, trackers, peers, endpoints, diagnostics, error text, or
payload content.

## Why Keep These Facts

A few coarse local facts can make voluntary feedback substantially more useful.
For example, knowing that a report came after twenty successful downloads over
ninety days is different from a report on first launch before any torrent was
accepted. The same facts can support restrained local milestones such as
asking an established successful user whether they want to leave a review.

Local collection and remote transmission remain separate decisions. Explicit
direction nevertheless accepts three closed transmission surfaces for these
facts: the developer-operated update check, a user-opened feedback page, and
the browser extension's uninstall survey. They are not permission for a
continuous event stream, a third-party analytics SDK, or unrelated reporting.

## Identity Vocabulary

Do not reuse one identifier across unrelated ownership boundaries:

| Identity | Scope and purpose | Persistence and transmission |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Installation ID | One product installation across profiles and application updates | Random resettable 128-bit value in installation product state; may be sent only through the disclosed update, feedback, and extension-uninstall boundaries |
| Profile ID | One torrent catalog, settings set, roots, and application-service instance | Stable beneath the profile root; never an analytics identity |
| Client instance ID | One attached presentation lifetime and its reconnect/takeover ownership | Ephemeral; not product history |
| Report ID | One user-submitted feedback or support case | Generated for that submission; may be sent with the visible report |
| Separate analytics ID | A second identity created only for remote measurement | Does not exist and is not needed by the accepted design; the installation ID is the sole disclosed pseudonymous product identity |

RSTorrent currently has stable profile identity, an ephemeral WebSocket
client-instance identity, and the desktop updater's random durable installation
ID. That updater ID is the seed for the accepted installation identity rather
than a reason to create another telemetry UUID. The installation ID is
pseudonymous, not anonymous: repeated allowed requests can be correlated until
the user resets it. It is never derived from a profile ID, pairing ID, device
serial, account, path, peer ID, or hardware fingerprint and is never an
authentication credential.

An installation's age is the elapsed time since its product state was first
created. Presentation should call this **days since first use** unless platform
backup, restore, uninstall, and reinstall behavior makes a stronger "days
installed" claim truthful. Reset-all-data creates a new installation identity;
ordinary profile deletion does not.

## Accepted Storage Boundary

Use an installation-wide, application-private `product.db` above profile
directories:

```text
application data/
  product.db
  profiles/
    <stable-profile-id>/
      session.db
```

Transfer-history storage may add a separate profile-local derived-data store;
it does not absorb installation product state. Conversely, `product.db` does
not become a transfer time-series database or a second torrent-catalog
authority.

One product-lifetime owner above application-service instances owns
`product.db`. Platform adapters supply the application-data root, current
product version, wall-clock observation, and foreground lifecycle facts.
Profile application services publish bounded semantic milestones upward only
after the authoritative profile transition succeeds. Product clients read a
typed summary and record prompt disposition through that owner; they do not
open SQLite independently.

The initial store is local to one installation and does not sync through an
operating-system account or merge across devices. Tactical `208` selects
Android app-private backup exclusion, while a deliberate desktop file-level
backup/restore also restores `product.db` and therefore its identity, age,
prompt dispositions, and counters. A later platform must state its backup
behavior before enabling transmission.

`product.db` is durable product state, not disposable telemetry. Its corruption
or write failure must be observable and conservatively resettable, but it must
not establish torrent resume truth or prevent a download from running. Whether
the future installation-level profile registry shares this database requires a
separate failure-domain decision when that registry is designed.

## Initial Product Summary

The first schema should remain closed and typed. Candidate installation facts
are:

- installation ID and product-state creation time;
- first-seen and current product versions;
- last product start and last completed clean shutdown;
- total successfully added torrents;
- total downloads completed from an incomplete state; and
- foreground product sessions, if the platform-independent session boundary is
  defined precisely enough to count consistently.

Counters are unsigned, saturating, and monotonically increasing. They are
diagnostic and engagement context, not billing, protocol, or correctness
evidence. A write failure degrades the summary and local prompting without
rolling back the torrent command that produced the milestone.

Counter meanings must be based on semantic transitions rather than UI or
transport notifications:

- **Torrents added** advances once after creation of a new durable catalog
  record succeeds. Invalid input, a rejected duplicate, a no-op, and replay of
  the same request do not advance it. Removing and later adding a new catalog
  record is another addition.
- **Downloads completed** advances once when a torrent added incomplete first
  reaches complete through download work. Restart restoration, repeated
  completion notification, recheck of already complete content, and importing
  preexisting complete content do not advance it.
- **Foreground sessions** must mean an intentional product activation, not a
  WebSocket reconnect, webview reload, background-service restart, activity
  recreation, or diagnostic-client connection. Omit this counter until
  desktop and Android can share an honest definition.

The implementation may add a small number of similarly defined coarse facts
when a concrete feedback or prompt use requires them. It must not accept
arbitrary metric names or silently turn every application event into retained
history.

## Prompt Campaign State

Prompt state means the durable disposition of a specific in-product
solicitation, such as:

- asking a successful established user to leave a store review;
- offering the browser extension when the native product is already useful;
- requesting feedback after a meaningful milestone; or
- offering an explicit JSTorrent migration or successor handoff.

Usage counters exist independently from prompts. Do not add generic prompt
rows merely because the product store exists. When a concrete prompt is
accepted, give its code-defined campaign a stable versioned key and retain only
the state required to avoid nagging: first/last shown time, bounded shown count,
and a typed disposition such as `not_now`, `declined`, or `completed`.

Eligibility rules live in reviewed product code and use the local summary;
they are not remotely mutable analytics rules. A prompt records `shown` only
when it was actually visible. `Not now` permits a documented cooldown, while
`declined` and `completed` suppress that campaign permanently unless a future
campaign has materially different purpose and a new key.

## Operational Facts

Startup, clean-shutdown completion, detection of a previous unclean stop,
product-version change, and schema-migration outcome are sparse typed
installation facts rather than numeric transfer buckets. `product.db` is their
natural scope if a later tactical demonstrates a diagnostic or migration need.

That tactical must decide whether each fact needs only a latest value or a
bounded chronological record. It must define crash semantics, retention,
backup behavior, and payload limits before adding an event table. Error text,
paths, URLs, torrent identity, and arbitrary structured payloads do not belong
in a generic operational record.

## Feedback, Update Counting, And Uninstall Survey

The first implementation uses one default-on, plainly disclosed
**Include pseudonymous usage statistics** preference. Turning it off is
durable and suppresses the installation ID and usage summary from every
allowed transmission surface. Update checks then remain anonymous apart from
ordinary request metadata. Local counters may continue so that re-enabling the
preference and local engagement decisions retain an honest summary.

A separate **Reset usage statistics and identifier** action rotates the
installation ID and resets the coarse counters and first-use timestamp without
removing torrents, payload, roots, settings, profile state, pairing, or the
application. Full application-data clearing also resets them. Presentation
must not describe either operation as deleting server logs already received.

A feedback or bug-report surface builds its context snapshot locally, shows
the exact optional fields before browser navigation or submission, and lets
the user uncheck inclusion for that one report without changing the durable
preference. Appropriate context is closed to:

- product and platform version;
- days since first use;
- the closed aggregate counters;
- whether the product has ever successfully connected to its engine/backend;
  and
- Android's already accepted OS release and manufacturer/model fields.

The current JSTorrent-hosted feedback and uninstall pages consume query
parameters before the embedded Google Form is submitted. That behavior is
accepted for replacement parity only after the confirmation names the fields
and recipients. The product privacy presentation must explain that query
values can reach browser history, website logs and referrers, the embedded
Google Form, and the page's existing Cloudflare analytics. Do not claim that
this flow is anonymous, local-only, or transmitted only on final form
submission.

The extension cannot ask for consent after it has been removed. While
installed it maintains a bounded uninstall URL from the last durable privacy
preference and cached summary. If statistics are disabled or state is
unavailable, uninstall may still open the survey but its URL contains no
stable ID or usage counters. The URL is always length-bounded and contains no
user prose or diagnostic text.

The exact cross-surface allowlist is product version, platform, installation
ID, days since first use, torrents added, downloads completed, foreground
sessions, and ever-connected state, plus the existing Android environment
fields. A surface uses only the subset it needs. Torrent identity/content,
paths, roots, trackers, peers, network addresses, credentials, account or
hardware identifiers, errors, logs, diagnostics, and arbitrary event payloads
are prohibited.

Earlier maintainer direction on 2026-09-01 selected the first closed
replacement-parity exception in completed Tactical
[`206`](../tactical/206-android-jstorrent-feedback-handoff.md). The Android
Advanced Settings action opens the existing JSTorrent feedback page with
exactly four current-JSTorrent environment fields in its query: literal
platform `android`, application version name, Android release, and device
manufacturer/model. Those fields are transmitted on navigation and may reach
browser history, website logs/referrers, the embedded Google Form, and the
page's existing analytics before form submission. No stable identifier,
counter, error, runtime diagnostic, lifecycle fact, torrent/peer/storage fact,
or user prose may enter that URL. Tactical `208` may widen it only to the
accepted, previewed product summary after privacy presentation and controls
land; until then Tactical `206`'s exact four-field URL remains authoritative.

## JSTorrent Reference Evidence

The inspected JSTorrent revision is
`0cad4dacf540f5be42ee53c4f1e1da27aa1b3685`.

- `extension/src/lib/telemetry-id.ts` creates a random UUID in
  `chrome.storage.local` under `telemetryId`.
- `extension/src/lib/metrics.ts` keeps completed-download, torrent-add, and
  session counters plus per-platform/device aggregates in
  `chrome.storage.sync`, while the installation timestamp stays local.
- The extension's uninstall URL contains version, telemetry ID, days,
  connection status, downloads, additions, sessions, and device count.
- `android/app/src/main/java/com/jstorrent/app/settings/MetricsStore.kt` keeps a
  local install UUID, timestamp, counters, and review-prompt state in dedicated
  preferences. Its review rule requires three completed downloads and seven
  days, uses a thirty-day `not now` cooldown, and respects permanent decline
  or completion.
- `docs/archive/design/profile-system.md` later separates telemetry ID from
  profile ID explicitly, retaining the former only for metrics and the latter
  for session state and roots.

RSTorrent adopts the useful separation, local milestone behavior, and
disclosed feedback/uninstall product outcome. It does not adopt Chrome account
sync, the storage format, hardware-derived identity, a generic event API, or
silent transmission outside the exact allowlist.

JSTorrent makes the usage summary visible in its uninstall and feedback pages,
encodes context in the page URL, and uses it to load a pre-populated Google
Forms iframe. Form submission is optional, yet visiting the page can already
disclose the query and iframe parameters. RSTorrent preserves this product
behavior with truthful preview, disclosure, opt-out, and reset controls rather
than describing navigation as a private local preview.

## Invariants

- Product-state scope is one local installation, not one torrent profile,
  presentation, process, device account, or remote user.
- Profile and transport identities are never repurposed as analytics identity.
- The installation identity is pseudonymous, resettable, and never an
  authorization or hardware identity.
- Local measurement does not authorize transmission beyond the update,
  user-opened feedback, and extension-uninstall boundaries.
- Prompt eligibility is evaluated locally and prompt dismissal is durable.
- Counter and prompt writes are low-frequency and never enter peer, hashing,
  storage, or other engine hot paths.
- Derived product-state failure cannot establish or invalidate verified torrent
  state and cannot fail a download.
- Optional feedback context is visible before navigation, can be omitted for
  one report, and excludes sensitive torrent, endpoint, and diagnostic data.
- Disabling statistics suppresses stable identity and counters on every
  allowed transmission surface; reset rotates identity without touching
  torrent product state.
- Adding a counter, prompt campaign, operational event, submitted field, or
  identity use requires a named semantic purpose and bounded representation.

## Known Gaps And Next Work

- Implement Tactical `208`'s exact `product.db` schema, crash-safe semantic
  milestone transfer, privacy preference, preview, reset, updater-ID adoption,
  and extension-local uninstall summary. Until it lands, preserve Tactical
  `206`'s four-field Android URL and the updater's existing `cfu-id` behavior.
- Reconcile Tactical `207` clear-data semantics with the new store: Reset
  engine settings preserves product metrics, while either clear-data outcome
  resets the product identity and metrics without widening payload deletion.
- Update the hosted JSTorrent privacy, feedback, and uninstall presentation
  before enabling richer transmission. The current privacy page's claim that
  no analytics or usage data is collected would be false after enablement.
- Prove Tactical `208`'s selected backup/reinstall behavior and honest
  cross-platform foreground-session boundaries; omit the counter on a platform
  until its semantics are proven.
- Design each review, feedback, extension, or migration prompt as an explicit
  campaign with its own eligibility, cooldown, and disposition behavior.
- Decide whether sparse lifecycle/version facts need latest values or a bounded
  event record.
- Decide whether the installation-level profile registry remains separate from
  `product.db` after evaluating failure recovery and backup as one unit.
- Define deletion and migration behavior when replacing JSTorrent while
  preserving or intentionally resetting historical product context.
