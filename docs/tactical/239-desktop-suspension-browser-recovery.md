# Tactical 239: Desktop Suspension And Browser Recovery

Status: **Active; Linux installed checks blocked, 2026-09-29.** Campaign 231; follows 234/237.
Topics: `client-surfaces`, `runtime-configurations-and-headless-deployment`,
`application-connection-architecture`, `desktop-jstorrent-replacement`.

## Scope And Stopping Condition

Use the final installed beta packages and fresh controlled roots on claimed
macOS/Windows/Linux guests. Close/restart the separate test browser during a
private bounded transfer, reopen its existing extension page attach-only and
prove the same runtime/library, tray and converged state. Verify complete
payload with an independent SHA-256 and authoritative piece counts.

Query real guest sleep/wake capabilities first. Exercise supported target
suspension/resume and actual guest sleep/wake only with a supported recovery
path. VM snapshot/pause, native OS sleep, browser closure and discarded-page
freezing are distinct evidence classes; never relabel one as another. No
controller sleep, outer input, unsupported hypervisor mutation or policy bypass.

Stop after the bounded available-platform recovery matrix, explicit Quit plus
browser restart without resurrection, fresh user-intent relaunch, resource
samples and cleanup. Native OS sleep unavailable in virtual hardware remains
a physical-platform qualification gap. No broader endurance or release claim.

## Contracts And Ordered Work

Keep 234's one runtime, persistent tray, attach-only passive reconnect and
native tray Open rules. Reuse its 32-MiB independently generated fixture and
bounded libtorrent seed; no public swarm, personal content or importer.
One task owns the seed, server, browser and any exact guest-access firewall
rule; close/join, delete owned artifacts and release claims at completion.
No engine/protocol algorithm or Android behavior change is planned.

Review 165's power policy, current connection/page cleanup, pinned keepawake
platform adapters and official Apple/Windows/Linux power documentation before
power experiments. Preserve settings and distinguish a user-forced suspension
from idle-sleep inhibition. Run scripts and affected builder tests before
installed experiments. A discovered engine fix requires the engine campaign
source/test oracle and Android parity analysis before implementation.

For efficiency, a platform's 239 cases may reuse 237's still-owned controlled
installation before cleanup; evidence remains under this separate tactical.

## Initial Platform Evidence

Reviewed pinned keepawake 0.6.1 `src/sys/{macos,windows}.rs`, Apple's installed
`pmset(1)` scheduling/sleep contract and IOKit `IOReturn.h`, official Windows
[SetThreadExecutionState](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setthreadexecutionstate)
and Chrome [worker lifecycle](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/service-workers/lifecycle).
Active downloading holds an idle-system-sleep assertion, not a system-sleep
or display assertion. No worker keepalive is introduced.

Windows 11 build 26200 virtual firmware reports every sleep/hibernate state
unavailable (`powercfg /a`); Machine Control also does not advertise provider
suspension there. macOS 26.6.2 advertises sleep, but root `pmset sleepnow`
returns `0xe00002e2` (`kIOReturnNotPermitted`). The exact task-owned scheduled
wake is cancelled afterward; no inherited wake event existed or was removed.
These are testbed limitations, not passing native sleep tests. Supported Tart
suspend/resume is exercised separately without claiming native OS wake events.

The new opt-in `verify-desktop-suspension-recovery.mjs` uses attach-only
bootstrap, bounded six-second replies and 180-second progress observations.
It records sanitized root/torrent identities, verifies the same runtime and
non-regressing piece counts after recovery, and independently hashes the
32-MiB controlled payload at completion. It accepts the existing paused
compatibility fixture beside the active transfer. Its first live record
found ambiguous text `connected` (connection health plus a live peer); scope
the wait to the connection div, leaving authenticated identity checks intact.

## macOS Transfer Recovery

The first VM pause run is **invalid as transfer-recovery evidence**: the
fixture bound libtorrent to port zero and captured that port once in its
tracker response. Host interface refresh reopened its listener on a new port,
while the tracker kept advertising the closed old port. The UI truthfully
showed the sole peer failure-limited after three failures; 119/512 pieces
remained verified. Reachable HTTP tracker and live runtime were insufficient
to establish a healthy seed. No engine change was made.

The fixture now selects one ephemeral port before session creation, uses that
fixed port with `listen_system_port_fallback=false` and
`max_retry_port_bind=0`, and checks the live listener on every tracker reply.
A missing listener returns HTTP 503 rather than a stale compact peer. Its
receipt includes listener/tracker ports. Reviewed pinned libtorrent
`7d7fc38f` `include/libtorrent/settings_pack.hpp` listen-interface and fallback
contracts and `src/session_impl.cpp` listener reopening. This changes only
independently authored test infrastructure, not product networking or Android.

Repeated with a new owned transfer in the same native-selected root. The
runner recorded 2/512 verified pieces, then common `target suspend` and
`target ensure-ready` preserved runtime identity and reached 41 pieces.
`verify-desktop-intent-lifecycle.mjs browser-close`, a real test-browser restart
with `--restore-last-session`, and attach-only recovery reached 69 pieces
with unchanged runtime/root/torrent identity and intent. Removing the temporary
64-KiB/s client limit completed all 512 pieces within the 180-second deadline.
Independent file read verified 33,554,432 bytes and SHA-256
`99080b09c925782f67975d36476f171ee4e8b367e2a893d07a88bd70028b3fe8`.
The seed retained its fixed listening port and an established guest connection
after resume. Native tray Show also opened the same library while the browser
was closed in the first run. One sample was 142,256 KiB RSS; this is a sample,
not an endurance bound. Joined Quit/browser restore and final cleanup pass
as recorded below. Windows evidence follows; Linux remains unqualified.

## Windows Browser Recovery

The fixed-listener private seed uses libtorrent 2.0.13.0. Record 3/512 verified
pieces, close the actual test browser and native window, then reopen the test
browser with session restoration. Attach-only recovery observes the same
runtime/root/torrent and 104 pieces. Remove the temporary 64-KiB/s limit;
completion reaches 512/512 and independent SHA-256 verifies the exact 32-MiB
payload above. A detached sample is 54,579,200 bytes working set / 486 handles.
Joined tray Quit, browser restart, two passive reload/worker-stop cycles and
35 seconds do not resurrect; explicit Start succeeds. No Windows native sleep
or provider pause is claimed. Inherited-state restoration passes all 319 file
hashes, eight registry states and 1,482 source-overlay paths; guest is off and
claim released. macOS cleanup restores its inherited suspended state and
releases its claim; no owned browser/runtime/helper remains.

macOS also passes joined Quit plus browser restart, two reload/worker-stop
cycles and 35 seconds without resurrection, followed by explicit Start.

Linux initial readiness passed, but GNOME Shell segfaulted in
`libgobject-2.0.so.0.8000.0` at 16:22:22 UTC during initial native UI setup.
Wayland disconnected and the product exited with broken-display-pipe errors.
Doctor then reports missing desktop/resident, with guest administration intact;
`ensure-ready` directs a read-only maintenance audit. Recovery follows below.
This is neither passing suspension evidence nor a diagnosed product regression.

Linux read-only maintenance audit finds a healthy package/guest-agent baseline
but unavailable resident after the compositor failure. Common `target reboot`
and `target ensure-ready` restore an unlocked, fully ready desktop. Native UI
setup now succeeds. No guest policy, package upgrade or Machine Control source
change was needed; keep the earlier compositor crash in the evidence.


## Linux Blocker And Restart

The recovered session reaches its inherited five-minute lock before native-root
selection completes. Doctor explicitly reports `desktop=locked`; inherited
`lock-enabled=true` and `idle-delay=300` remain unchanged. Stop interactive
work and request direct user unlock. No password, lock bypass or reboot to
avoid authentication is used. A later doctor still reports locked. No Linux
239 transfer/browser/sleep result or 238 signed updater result is claimed.
The native app had started and displayed its folder dialog; no root/torrent was
added and no test browser was launched. `/sys/power/state` offers `freeze mem`,
with `[s2idle]`; no native sleep or RTC wake event was attempted.

The installed debug DEB is 235's qualified x86_64 artifact, SHA-256
`f797456de043dd7002f5f4bb3d0c537b18f04c7e55ed0efef83d99f3b6c5576c`.
Before installation, ELF architecture and all `ldd` dependencies are checked
against Ubuntu 24.04.4 x86_64 / glibc 2.39 / WebKitGTK 2.52.6. For the planned
AppImage lane, apt simulation and installation add only `libfuse2t64`
2.9.9-8.1build1, following the official AppImage Ubuntu guidance; this is test
preparation, not installed signed-update evidence.

With no unlocked session available, cleanup stops the exact owned systemd user
unit through guest administration. This is cleanup termination, not native
Quit evidence. Remove only the newly installed `rs-torrent` and `libfuse2t64`
packages, fresh product profile, task directory and owned screenshot; no
`autoremove`, policy change or inherited data deletion. Verify owned executable,
process and artifact absence, return the guest to its inherited off state and
release the claim. Remove owned controller seed/server and exact temporary
firewall rules. Incremental builder caches remain.

Next executable action: claim a ready unlocked Linux guest, prepare a fresh
root through native UI, and repeat the bounded browser/transfer matrix with a
new fixed-port seed. Query actual power support and supported recovery before
any sleep experiment; do not reuse expired seed endpoints. Separately run
238's signed AppImage cohort. Native physical sleep, broader endurance and
signed current-source delivery remain open; importer work waits for discussion.

## Reproducible Runner Sequence

Run the fixture on the builder with `uv run --project tests/interop --locked
python tests/interop/desktop_extension_seed.py --root "$FIXTURE_ROOT"
--bind "$GUEST_REACHABLE_ADDRESS" --seconds 1800`. Copy only its generated
metainfo and the runner into the claimed guest. Use the native-selected root
and guest-owned Chrome for Testing CDP endpoint; preserve credentials in memory.

```sh
node scripts/verify-desktop-suspension-recovery.mjs limit
node scripts/verify-desktop-suspension-recovery.mjs record "$BASELINE"
# Supported VM suspend/resume, or real browser close and session restoration.
node scripts/verify-desktop-suspension-recovery.mjs recover "$BASELINE"
node scripts/verify-desktop-suspension-recovery.mjs unlimit
node scripts/verify-desktop-suspension-recovery.mjs complete "$BASELINE" "$PAYLOAD"
```

Set `RSTORRENT_PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE` to the guest's installed Playwright module;
use the runner's CDP override when its default differs. Final source validation:
21 release/package/input Node tests pass, macOS desktop library 53 tests and
Windows desktop library 50 tests pass, Node syntax and Python compile checks
pass. Runtime production code is unchanged in this slice; these are not full
workspace Clippy/test claims. Installed observations above are separate from
scripted assertions and single resource samples are not high-water bounds.
