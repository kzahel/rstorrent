# Tactical 231: JSTorrent Migration Working Campaign

Status: **Active planning, 2026-09-30.** This is the working tracker for
“ripping the Band-Aid off.” Maintainer direction selects desktop extension
control as the first implementation focus and user-experience continuity as
the North Star. Tactical 241 implements the bounded local importer; no production rollout has run.

Topic: [`desktop-jstorrent-replacement`](../topics/desktop-jstorrent-replacement.md)

This parent campaign tracks decisions, rehearsals, evidence and follow-up
slices. Each implementation slice has its own bounded tactical. The living
topic owns the source survey and current migration contract; this document
owns the executable work queue and acceptance ledger.

Direction on 2026-09-30 narrows the initial migration to a branded JSTorrent
replacement update with a fresh successor catalog or an existing latest-format
RSTorrent profile. Keep existing torrents/settings, report duplicate legacy
torrents as already present, and continue distinct imports. Field merging,
older RSTorrent profile conversion and a general conflict-resolution UI are
outside this allowance. The extension may
require the desktop update outright, and a disclosed temporary Chromebook
Android browser-control gap is acceptable with standalone Android as the
fallback. Desktop and Android migration no longer require synchronized
completion. Exact production ordering remains open; 241 implements local import
and 242/243 add managed host fencing and bounded installed three-platform
replacement.
Other package/architecture routes and production rollout remain unqualified.

## North Star

An existing JSTorrent user should still open the extension, see their library,
choose a folder, add and manage torrents, leave downloads running, and report
a problem through familiar journeys. Opening the desktop or Android native UI
should show the same backend state. The Rust engine replaces the internals;
users should not have to understand the new process topology.

Preserve useful behavior, not every pixel or legacy implementation detail.
Record unavoidable changes, unsupported features and recovery steps explicitly.
Do not force desktop-window use as the default replacement for the browser UI.
An explicit desktop-update requirement and a temporary Android browser-control
gap are accepted transition exceptions, rather than compatibility-bridge work.

The deliberate exception to legacy workflow continuity is desktop profiles:
there is one desktop library, with no profile picker or multi-profile product.
Migration takes the union of all legacy desktop profiles for the current OS
user. Every authorized extension connection, including connections from
different browser profiles, sees that same library. Legacy source provenance
exists only to make merging, reporting and recovery reliable.

| Configuration | Successor engine/state owner | Extension's job | Native UI's job |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop | One desktop app process and profile | Packaged shared React UI, browser integration, bootstrap and semantic control | Another view of that same owner; OS picker, tray, notifications and update integration remain native |
| Chromebook Android | Android foreground service, Rust engine and SAF roots | Packaged shared React UI, launch/pairing, semantic control and requests for Android folder selection | Compose view, pairing approval, system picker and service lifecycle |
| Chromebook Linux | Separate Crostini backend/profile | Existing launch/focus/setup handoff to the backend-served React tab | Linux backend owns storage and lifetime; it is not the Android library |

Tactical `194` already implements the Chromebook Android ownership shape,
including two attached views and detached transfers. It does not supply desktop
control, legacy state import or all browser media capabilities. Browser
rendering and commands remain JavaScript; peer networking, hashing, scheduling,
SQLite and payload writes remain native. No engine runs in the extension.

## Decision Log

| ID | Decision | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D-01 | Familiar extension-first and native-app workflows guide migration acceptance. | Accepted 2026-09-28 |
| D-02 | Implement desktop extension control before the first full migration rehearsal. | Selected 2026-09-28; Tactical `232` plans the slice |
| D-03 | Extension and native views attach to one backend; changing views is not profile takeover. | Accepted architecture |
| D-04 | Reuse the mature React UI and semantic application contract across presentations. | Accepted direction; extract only concrete shared seams |
| D-05 | Preserve JSTorrent production identity/updater trust at graduation; keep incubation identities during development. | Accepted direction; candidate/package mechanics remain open |
| D-06 | Best-effort import preserves valuable intent and rechecks bytes; legacy completion claims are not trusted. | Accepted integrity rule; exact field/cohort mapping remains proposed |
| D-07 | Local diagnostics and bug-report continuity precede a migration cohort. | Required outcome; reporting implementation remains open |
| D-08 | Union all legacy desktop profiles into one library; no successor multi-profile support or source-profile chooser. | Accepted 2026-09-28; bounded rules implemented in 241 |
| D-09 | Explicit extension open starts/attaches in background; desktop launch shows its native window. Both views coexist without preferred-UI routing. | Accepted in follow-up discussion |
| D-10 | Automatic reconnect attaches only; explicit Quit must not be undone by browser retries. Desktop bootstrap avoids routine code-entry pairing. | Accepted; protected bootstrap implemented in 232 |

| D-11 | Retain tray/status-bar icon whenever desktop runtime runs, even idle/paused; closing browser only detaches. Native close follows its existing setting. | Accepted 2026-09-29; 234 |
| D-12 | Fresh toolbar/Start/magnet/file intent may relaunch after Quit; automatic restore/retry/worker wake may only attach. | Accepted 2026-09-29; 234 |
| D-13 | Tray Open and OS torrent inputs use native UI; no preferred surface or browser-profile routing. | Accepted 2026-09-29; 234 |
| D-14 | Replace JSTorrent through its branded desktop update; allow a fresh catalog or existing latest-format RSTorrent profile. Existing torrents/settings win; duplicate legacy torrents are reported as already present. No field merging, older-profile conversion or general conflict-resolution UI. | Accepted and refined 2026-09-30 |
| D-15 | New extension may hard-require the new JSTorrent desktop; no legacy engine/IO bridge. Stale legacy clients must not become payload writers. | Accepted 2026-09-30 |
| D-16 | Temporary Chromebook extension-control loss for Rust Android is acceptable with clear standalone-app guidance; restoration does not block desktop migration. | Accepted 2026-09-30 |
| D-17 | One atomic catalog transaction includes fresh schema/settings/imports and one completion marker; no per-record migration ledger. | Implemented in 241, 2026-09-30 |

2026-09-30 follow-up selects near-term production replacement across desktop,
Android and extension, with JSTorrent branding/original icons before cutover.
Tactical [249](249-jstorrent-brand-and-extension-refresh.md) completes the bounded
original-icon/display-branding and extension popup/connection refresh. Android continuity means the existing Play app update,
not a new desktop-style updater. Production identities/signing/launch routes
remain an explicit installed qualification slice before shipment.

## Work Tracker

Maintainer direction on 2026-10-01 prioritizes ChromeOS onboarding/recovery
qualification on both physical Chromebooks, including pre-Play setup,
installation failures and explicit Linux fallback. Tactical
[253](253-chromeos-onboarding-recovery-and-physical-qualification.md) owns that
bounded next slice. The desktop rollout remains independently sequenced.

| ID | Work | State | Exit evidence / next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M-01 | Desktop extension control | Linux/Windows/macOS installed checkpoint complete in [`232`](232-desktop-extension-control.md); full rehearsal partial | Protected bootstrap, native picker, controlled bytes, shared library, singleton and Quit pass. Bounded intent/tray/browser lifecycle passes in [234](234-desktop-user-intent-and-background-lifecycle.md), including 64 reload/worker-stop cycles per guest and prompt view cleanup. Linux Quit/launch overlap is repaired in [235](235-linux-quit-launch-handoff.md). Broader endurance remains separate. |
| M-02 | Legacy cohort inventory and fixtures | [233](233-legacy-desktop-fixture-cohort.md): bounded Linux/Windows v0.2.1 cohort complete | Seven profiles/eight records plus two labeled mutations per platform; closed snapshot/payload oracle passes. Broader releases, browser-store variants and macOS remain unqualified. |
| M-03 | Legacy import and recovery | [241](241-atomic-legacy-desktop-import.md): local implementation complete; [242](242-legacy-desktop-handoff-rehearsal.md)/[243](243-windows-linux-legacy-replacement.md): bounded installed three-platform handoff complete | Atomic import/current-destination preservation, retry/crash/checker evidence plus managed old-host fencing, idle-host/registration failure, four-record installed import, missing roots, restart and source/payload preservation. [244](244-unavailable-storage-presentation.md) corrects shared React unavailable-root presentation with deterministic evidence; production/privacy/support qualification remains open. |
| M-04 | Support/report continuity | Required before user cohort | Failure-page report, bounded migration/backend context, familiar voluntary feedback journey and disclosure verification |
| M-05 | Installed desktop replacement rehearsal | Depends on M-01/03/04 | Old installed JSTorrent -> exact candidate -> restart/repair/rollback on macOS, Windows and Linux |
| M-06 | Extension update coordination | [236](236-desktop-compatibility-refusal-and-recovery.md)/[237](237-macos-windows-package-recovery.md): selected three-platform beta matrix passes | Terminal refusal, attach-only recovery, open-page replacement, credential rotation, repair and same-schema rollback pass. [238](238-signed-desktop-channel-recovery.md) passes three-platform signed updating of an older published cohort. [240](240-signed-desktop-control-qualification.md) adds signed current-source 801 publication, native updates and installed control/helper qualification. Original legacy pairs and ChromeOS shipment gates remain open. |
| M-07 | JSTorrent replacement cohort and graduation | Branding in [249](249-jstorrent-brand-and-extension-refresh.md), production candidates in [250](250-jstorrent-production-identity-candidates.md); publication not scheduled | [Full cutover checklist](../jstorrent-cutover-checklist.md): original-key provisioning, exact signed/store artifacts, installed updating/import/recovery, source baseline, observation window and stop thresholds; no synchronized delivery requirement |
| M-08 | ChromeOS onboarding, troubleshooting and Linux fallback | Active, portable checkpoint passes: [253](253-chromeos-onboarding-recovery-and-physical-qualification.md) | Both physical devices; pre-Play/installation-failure journeys; explicit Linux choice with separate-library guidance; repeated verified downloads and recovery. Six injected packaged-browser journeys and bounded cohort-A isolated Android/Linux-runtime slices pass. Normal Linux launcher/browser registration fails; store journeys and cohort B remain open. |

No entry above implies feature completion from source presence alone. Keep
unrelated release and engine campaigns running under their own ownership.

## Rehearsal A: Extension Controls A Fresh Desktop Backend

This is the first end-to-end rehearsal, before any legacy state import.

1. Record source commit, artifact hashes, OS/architecture, extension identity,
   build versions and protocol capabilities. Use a disposable profile and
   independently generated single-file/multifile payloads with known hashes.
2. Through Machine Control, doctor and claim the selected target; acquire an
   isolated workspace when supported. Record inherited machine state. Install
   the test desktop package and the beta extension in a separately identified
   test browser. Do not use personal profiles or production download roots.
3. With the app stopped, open the extension. Prove one native backend becomes
   ready and the packaged React library opens without a forced desktop window.
   A repeated launch focuses/reuses the presentation rather than duplicating
   the backend or losing the selected library.
4. Choose a folder from the extension, exercise Cancel, then select a root.
   Add a magnet and a local `.torrent`, choose files, and complete a controlled
   transfer. Confirm the selected bytes independently and skipped-file behavior.
5. Open the native window. Confirm the same backend/profile/torrent identities.
   Pause/resume and change file selection/settings from each view; the other
   converges through the ordinary application contract.
   Attach from a second authorized browser profile and confirm the same library,
   without a profile selector, new catalog or takeover prompt.
6. Close the browser view, then exercise the configured desktop background
   behavior. Prove continued work under the chosen policy, reopen the extension,
   and recover current state. Separately test browser restart and service-worker
   suspension; neither should own engine lifetime.
7. Restart the app and simulate stale connection/bootstrap state, incompatible
   versions, picker interruption and connection loss during a command. Recovery
   must avoid duplicate adds, guessed command success and another engine owner.
8. Trigger an actionable connection failure and inspect/copy its bounded report.
   Explicit Quit closes listeners, subscriptions, picker requests and the engine.
   Capture process/handle/queue high-water evidence and verify cleanup.

The recommended fast loop is native Linux builds on a development controller
and installed testing in its matching Linux VM, after guest readiness passes.
The alternate-controller survey resolves Linux and Windows routes with both
guests off; the earlier macOS VM remains the ready fallback. Tactical `232`
records build/test placement. Repeat the installed gate across all three OSes;
a pass on one platform is a milestone, not cross-platform completion.

## Rehearsal B: A Real Legacy Library Crosses The Boundary

Build a fixture cohort through pinned old JSTorrent applications, not only by
handwriting the expected database schema:

| Fixture | Required observation |
| --- | --- |
| Empty and ordinary desktop-only profile | First-run behavior, settings disposition, no invented data |
| Extension-used and multiple legacy profiles with disjoint torrents | Automatic union into one library, every supported source accounted for, no profile-selection UI |
| Duplicate torrents across profiles, including different payload roots | One logical torrent per validated identity; retained payload copies and explicit location conflicts |
| Identical root keys in different profiles and conflicting settings/intent | Source-qualified root mapping, one settings set, deterministic dispositions and no implicit activity/privacy expansion |
| Complete single-file and multifile torrent | Source-offline verification and seeding; exact bytes retained |
| Partial transfer with skipped neighboring files | Selection preserved; verified reuse versus necessary redownload measured |
| Paused torrent and queued/rate-limited work | User intent retained without surprise download/seed activation |
| Magnet with and without cached metadata/selection | Hash/source validation and truthful pending state |
| Multiple roots, removed disk and permission denial | Exact root binding; actionable repair without relocation |
| Duplicate, malformed, oversized or missing source record | Bounded per-record outcome, no silent success or entire-library disappearance |
| Unicode/case-sensitive paths, symlinks and foreign partial state | Safe path semantics and explicit unsupported cases |

For each cohort:

1. Record original user-visible state, expected payload hashes, source versions
   and feature/settings dispositions for all source profiles. Stop all old
   writers and take consistent snapshots, including SQLite WAL semantics.
   Preserve those snapshots unchanged.
2. Run read-only discovery/preview. Compare imported/needs-attention/skipped
   counts and root mappings against the expected union fixture. Account for
   every source record as imported, coalesced, conflicting or skipped with a
   reason, and distinguish source counts from unique destination torrents.
   No engine activation or payload mutation belongs to preview.
3. Import into separate successor state, initially held. Inject interruption
   at snapshot completion, before/after the atomic catalog commit, check start and activation
   handoff. Retry and restart must converge without duplicate records or loss.
4. Recheck with controlled peers offline; confirm correct byte reuse and the
   inability of legacy bitfields to hide deliberately corrupted content. Then
   permit controlled repair and verify exact final hashes.
5. Open the extension and native UI, confirm the same recovered library and
   test ordinary commands, folder repair, support reporting and restart.
6. Reopen the importer and vary source enumeration order to prove idempotence
   and deterministic union results. Exercise keep-data removal and
   uninstall/reinstall in fixtures without deleting unrelated content.
7. Rehearse rollback: stop/join the successor, restore the old app/profile
   authority, and recheck any payload the successor changed. Explicitly test
   stale legacy UI pages/relaunches attempting to become a second writer.

Add an existing latest-format destination to this rehearsal: duplicate torrents
at the same and different locations, distinct legacy imports, a malformed
legacy record, and repeated attempts. Verify that existing torrents, settings,
default root and both payload copies remain unchanged; duplicates are reported
as already present and unrelated valid imports continue. Older or unreadable
destinations require an actionable error without overwrite, not conversion.

The fixture conflict cases require bounded visible dispositions, not a general
conflict-repair product or field-by-field library merging. Importer bounds,
snapshot protocol, writer fencing and crash checkpoints must
be finalized in its own tactical before this rehearsal can run. A retained
database or VM snapshot alone is not a rollback contract for external payload.

## Rehearsal C: The Installed Update And Mixed-Version Journey

Use actual old installed packages, including their original app identifiers,
host registration and updater configuration. Qualify the candidate through the
intended signed update path in isolated test infrastructure before production
route changes. Record explicit extension/browser update order and cover:

- old extension + old desktop;
- new extension + old desktop, with a terminal desktop-update requirement;
- old extension, including an already-open engine page, + new desktop;
- new extension + new desktop; and
- cancelled update, interrupted replacement, registration repair and rollback.

Verify cold launch, native associations, magnet/browser integration, tray,
folder picker, reporting, window/background policy and process cleanup. Track
each platform/package/architecture result separately. Re-run the existing
ChromeOS Android disposition and Crostini launcher journey before shipping a
shared extension change. A clearly disclosed temporary Android browser-control
gap with usable standalone Android satisfies the selected initial disposition;
full pairing/control restoration is a follow-up. Physical Android validation
uses Machine Control's ChromeOS guide and doctor, with project-owned
deployment/assertions.

## Evidence And Stop Rules

Each run records fixture and artifact identity, actions, independently observed
outcomes, import/check counts, timings, resource peaks, recovery result and
cleanup. Keep bounded sanitized summaries in the repository; raw profiles,
tokens, personal paths and machine inventory stay out. Delete owned temporary
captures, payload and logs after extracting the needed evidence.

Data loss/corruption, two payload writers, wrong-profile attachment,
unauthorized control or unexplained reported success blocks progression.
Other missing legacy features require a named product disposition rather than
being silently ignored. Public-swarm tests, signing/release operations and
production routing remain separately scoped.

## Restart Checkpoint

- ChromeOS bounded update-order checkpoint: 248 records the independently
  staggered extension/Android contract, excludes Crostini automatic migration,
  implements update/retry guidance, and passes API 28/35 controlled installed
  replacement from real released extension session/settings writers. Fresh
  pairing renders and controls the same Android-owned imported library. Source
  artifacts, emulator transport seams and precise physical/store/historical
  limits are recorded there; no personal installed library is replaced.

- Completed: source survey and draft field mapping in the living topic;
  read-only Machine Control discovery/doctor checks; this campaign plan.
- Completed first control checkpoint: Tactical `232` implements one desktop
  owner/library, protected native bootstrap and authenticated shared React.
  Claimed Linux VM evidence proves cold/warm launch, singleton races/repeated
  clicks, native-root preparation, two-view pause/resume, invalid/stale token
  refusal and Quit without resurrection. Exact source/artifact hashes, tests,
  resource samples and cleanup are recorded in that tactical.
- Current: `232` installed control and `234` bounded desktop lifecycle pass;
  full campaign rehearsal remains partial.
- Installed Linux and Windows follow-up: native bootstrap, picker
  selection/Cancel/detach/Quit, exact private 32-MiB transfer, two-view
  convergence, source-offline restart and registration repair pass. Linux
  also proves transfer while detached. The macOS installed counterpart now passes
  with owned AppKit picking, same-UID bootstrap, serialized cold starts and
  joined menu/tray shutdown; exact commands and artifact hashes are in `232`.
- M-02 preparation: Tactical 233 pins released desktop/extension artifacts,
  generates seven legacy profiles on each guest, and verifies closed SQLite,
  torrent identities, bitfields and payload pieces independently. 241 consumes its exports through real SQLite and implements the bounded union
  dispositions, with new corruption, cached-metadata and restart mutations.
- Completed follow-ups: 237 extends selected beta package replacement/repair/
  rollback to macOS and Windows. 238 passes native signed 0.2.301 → 0.2.501
  update/relaunch and Stable catch-up on all three platforms; published source
  predates extension control, so it is not signed current-source delivery.
  239 passes same-owner browser restart and independently verified 32-MiB
  completion on all three, plus macOS VM suspend/resume and joined Quit without
  browser-driven resurrection. The Linux lock blocker is superseded by explicit
  VM recreation, canonical stored credentials and a fresh native-selected root.
- Linux native suspend-to-idle failed to recover despite an RTC alarm precheck;
  supported forced-stop/readiness restored the disposable guest. No native sleep
  pass or product regression is inferred. The final browser/transfer matrix was
  repeated independently with fresh fixture bytes. All task state is cleaned
  up, the new Linux VM is retained off with its password locator, Windows is off,
  macOS is suspended, and claims are released.
- 240 completes the requested signed current-source Latest release: immutable
  0.2.801 at fc401ecf, notarized/stapled outer DMGs, signed helper installation,
  native 701-to-801 updates and repeated three-platform control/transfer/picker/
  Quit/registration-repair evidence. Exact public hashes and installed limits
  are recorded there; Stable stays 0.1.4.
- M-03 local completion: 241 commits fresh schema/settings/roots/torrents and
  one completion report atomically, preserves current destination records,
  snapshots WAL, rejects live hosts and reuses the ordinary full checker.
  No per-record progress ledger or personal migration is used.
- M-03 installed follow-up: 242 fences managed legacy registrations only under
  the future production identity, refuses same-user old processes before import
  and engine startup, and shows asynchronous native startup guidance. A generated
  macOS v0.2.1 replacement passes idle-host/registration failures, four-record
  import, valid/corrupt rechecking, missing-root preservation, nine registered
  refusal routes, Quit/restart and unchanged source data/payload. SQLite may
  initialize empty WAL and transient SHM files; original database/nonempty WAL
  bytes and KV stay unchanged. Current incubation does not claim the old host name.
- M-03 platform follow-up: 243 passes Windows x64 NSIS and Linux x64 AppImage
  replacement with eight/six refusal routes, identical source/payload data,
  joined restart and four persisted paused imports. Native Windows tests expose
  and repair read-only private-snapshot syncing; 18 migration tests pass on
  Windows, Linux and macOS. The unavailable-root row still displays Downloading
  despite paused intent; 244 corrects the shared React mapping with deterministic
  adapter/component and backend migration evidence, without an installed rerun.
- Next executable actions: qualify 250's production candidates against the
  [full cutover checklist](../jstorrent-cutover-checklist.md). Confirm original
  private signing material and Play signing/max versions;
  then exercise exact signed installed updates and same-ID extension replacement.
  Support/privacy/settings and historical launch-route dispositions remain open.
  Interrupted-update, physical sleep/wake
  and broader endurance evidence remain independent work.
- Rehearsal A: **partial; three-platform installed control and bounded
  lifecycle/transfer checkpoints complete**. Rehearsal B: **partial; bounded
  generated installed three-platform handoff complete in 242/243**;
  C: **partial, selected three-platform beta compatibility and published
  signed-cohort and current-source updates**. No migration-ready or rollout-ready
  claim. 241 passes local fixture import and restart evidence. No personal
  migration or production rollout has run. 242/243's unsigned local candidates
  do not qualify signed production updating, actual store pairs, complete
  UI/privacy continuity, other package routes or active-payload rollback.
- Remaining campaign decisions: broader supported source formats, unsupported
  settings/privacy/support dispositions and exact replacement/
  extension release order, Android-control restoration timing, compatibility
  baseline and rollback support duration. A legacy protocol bridge, older
  RSTorrent profile conversion and field-by-field merging are not required.

Tactical [252](252-jstorrent-opt-in-upgrade-rehearsal.md) now qualifies bounded
original-key 0.2.1-to-0.3.0 HTTPS automatic updating on Linux x64, Windows x64
and macOS arm64, ordinary Windows/macOS GUI updating, signature refusals/retries
and Linux/Windows download interruption/retries. Generated two-profile migration,
settings, checking, registered refusal, source/payload and restart assertions
pass. The isolated trial is disabled and ordinary selection reverified; all owned
guests are restored and claims released. Broader package/source cohorts, Linux
old-release GUI rendering, actual extension/store pairs, controlled repair and
fresh signed branding qualification remain open. This does not close M-05 or
claim migration-ready/rollout-ready shipment.
