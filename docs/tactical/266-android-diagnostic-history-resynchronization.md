# Tactical 266: Android Diagnostic History Resynchronization

Status: Active, 2026-10-08. Bounded finish-line follow-up to 259.

Topics: `client-surfaces`, `application-view-api`,
`android-jstorrent-replacement`.

## Trigger, scope and stopping condition

The final-source physical background hour independently verifies its entire
40-MiB payload, then scoped logs show diagnostic resynchronization failing:
the 581,079-byte retained snapshot exceeds Android's 256-KiB diagnostic queue.
The source already bounds diagnostic retention to 2,048 records / 2 MiB, with
4-KiB records and bounded fields. The existing subscription contract supports
4-MiB queues, and its diagnostic retention test already uses that budget.

Request the existing 4-MiB bound only for Android's single owned diagnostic
subscription. Keep summary/detail queues, profiles, filtering, retention,
protocol, ABI, owner/task/cancellation and background/engine policy unchanged.
Strengthen the real retained-history contract test to prove that the old queue
refuses the bounded snapshot and that the supported budget delivers/resyncs it.
No new tasks, dependency, runtime architecture, public feed or store change.

This is a client policy repair, not an engine/protocol capability change.
The exact application retention/subscription implementation and tests are its
oracle; no libtorrent protocol behavior is adopted or altered. Read the owning
client/view/Android topics and existing presentation subscription/reducer.

Stop after focused retained-history regression, normal dual-ABI generated
Android build/JVM/lint/package checks, current physical diagnostic resync and
actual Live-library recovery, reconciled topics/checklist/report and a local
commit. Longer observation/upload qualification remains separately recorded;
failed receipts stay failed. Original-signature final candidate must be rebuilt
and its concrete internal review superseded before any separately approved upload.

## Owners, resource limits and evidence

`AndroidPresentationRepository` retains sole ownership of its diagnostic
subscription and one existing collection job. Closure/cancellation remains
unchanged. Maximum queued serialized diagnostic bytes are 4 MiB; Rust retention
remains 2 MiB plus bounded array/envelope overhead, and Kotlin reduction retains
its existing bounded history. No library/network payload enters this queue.
Record actual snapshot length/high-water evidence; do not imply an arbitrary
unbounded history now fits. The separate upload failure has no proven causal
connection and remains open under 259.

## Local build checkpoint

Source `2adf2eb1` passes the actual 473,255-byte retained-history regression,
including old-budget refusal and unchanged supported-budget resync. Session
clippy and all 387 passing session cases (two existing ignores) pass. Normal
original-signed release and generated dual-ABI isolated debug builds pass;
121 release JVM cases/lint and independent signing, labels, launcher, API,
ABI/alignment and notice validation pass. The APK/AAB are retained by exact
source/hash; code26 is not uploaded. Current physical stage trials remain active.
