# Implementation Tactical Docs

Bounded implementation plans and execution records live here.

Use zero-padded numeric filenames:

```text
000-first-slice.md
001-next-slice.md
```

Keep one coherent implementation slice per tactical. A tactical should be
small enough to have one falsifiable stopping condition while still producing
an end-to-end result. Parent sequencing documents are allowed when a campaign
needs them, but individual implementation work should still have bounded child
tacticals.

Create a tactical before substantial implementation. It should normally state:

- status;
- motivation and desired outcome;
- dependencies and references;
- scope;
- non-goals;
- contracts and invariants;
- implementation direction without unnecessary line-by-line prescription;
- exact validation and interoperability evidence; and
- the stopping condition or next-slice boundary.

Update the tactical as implementation reveals new facts. When complete, record
what landed, what validation actually ran, known gaps, and the recommended next
slice. Completed tacticals remain in place as execution records; living
direction belongs in `../topics/`.

## Work Selection And Concurrency

Multiple independent tacticals may be **Active** concurrently. **Active**,
**Ready**, and **Later** are descriptive planning states, not locks,
authorization gates, or a required global execution order. User-directed work
may proceed in any bounded tactical whose concrete dependencies are satisfied;
it does not need to displace or pause unrelated active work. Reconcile work
only when tacticals touch the same owner or edits, depend on one another's
outcome, or propose incompatible contracts.

Some completed tacticals retain **Now** language as an execution record from
the former single-`Now` convention. That wording is historical and does not
govern current work selection.

## Decision-Complete Tacticals

A tactical intended for autonomous execution must settle enough direction that
ordinary implementation discoveries do not require repeated approval. In
addition to the fields above, record:

- the stable topic scenarios or observations that define the problem and the
  exact subset the tactical must make pass;
- the normative specifications and pinned reference source/tests that must be
  surveyed before finalizing state transitions;
- the owner, task, cancellation, dependency, and data-flow map, including
  which state must remain runtime independent;
- exact initial resource bounds, or a bounded range plus explicit authority to
  choose and tighten a conservative value from reference and test evidence;
- shape-changing edge cases that must land with the common path rather than be
  deferred into an incompatible architecture;
- the staged implementation order and the intermediate gates that keep a
  large slice diagnosable;
- a validation matrix separating pure state, scripted runtime, controlled
  interoperability, platform build, and opt-in live evidence;
- explicit non-goals and the next-slice boundary; and
- an escalation contract naming what does and does not require human input.

Unless a tactical says otherwise, in-scope implementation authority includes
ordinary refactoring, adding adversarial cases implied by its invariants,
choosing internal names and module layout, tightening declared limits, fixing
newly exposed bugs at the same ownership boundary, updating generated types,
and updating the tactical and owning topics with actual evidence. These are not
reasons to stop merely because the initial plan did not predict the exact code
edit.

Stop for human direction when evidence requires a materially different product
behavior, protocol-support claim, persistence or compatibility contract,
external dependency or license posture, destructive data action, visible or
physical-device interaction not already authorized, or a significant expansion
beyond the tactical's stated owner and non-goals. An ordinary test failure,
internal refactor, conservative bound choice, public-smoke timeout, or a
reference implementation whose architecture differs from RSTorrent is not by
itself an escalation.

Autonomy does not broaden permissions silently. A tactical that needs public
network access, fixture downloads, emulator/device use, schema migration,
generated-contract changes, or another externally visible action must state
that scope and its cleanup or compatibility rules explicitly.

## Current Tacticals

- [`199-android-live-unmetered-network-enforcement.md`](199-android-live-unmetered-network-enforcement.md):
  ready; adds one default-off **Unmetered networks only** preference, an
  ordered Android default-network observer, and a live application/engine
  prerequisite that closes every BitTorrent DNS/socket/discovery owner while
  preserving torrent intent and Compose/ChromeOS control. VPN privacy, proxy,
  background lifecycle, and production migration remain separate.
- [`198-android-completion-and-attention-notifications.md`](198-android-completion-and-attention-notifications.md):
  ready; adds one Android-native edge owner for completion and fatal/storage-
  repair attention, default-on app preferences, bounded low/default/high
  channels, exact tap routing, and JSTorrent-like permission transparency.
  Denied or blocked notification visibility permits interactive use but stops
  the application and ChromeOS companion after visible interaction ends. It
  also fails safely on the target-35 `dataSync` timeout without claiming an
  indefinite background lifecycle.
- [`197-android-external-torrent-intake.md`](197-android-external-torrent-intake.md):
  ready; makes the one Compose/product-service owner a bounded Android handler
  for cold and warm `magnet:` plus temporary-grant `content://` `.torrent`
  activation. It preserves root/start confirmation, serializes hostile source
  reads, rejects file/HTTP/octet-stream breadth, and requires exact AVD
  manifest, lifecycle, privacy, resource, and controlled-transfer evidence.
- [`196-remote-direct-file-product-integration.md`](196-remote-direct-file-product-integration.md):
  active with implementation complete and qualification open; the retained
  lower-`rtc` endpoint is now a default-compiled but lazy desktop/headless
  product path. It authenticates bounded signaling inside the existing remote
  circuit, adds completed-file **Save file...**, default-on operator control
  and audit, and direct-only ICE through public Cloudflare STUN and strict mDNS
  candidates. The current-host product verifier and native Linux ARM64 build
  pass. Native Windows with a complete C toolchain, an independent-network
  selected pair, and a real streaming save picker remain open. OPFS, TURN,
  relay payload, incomplete files, general Open/Play, UPnP, deployment, and
  release remain excluded.
- [`195-webrtc-direct-file-feasibility-spike.md`](195-webrtc-direct-file-feasibility-spike.md):
  complete with a corrected Proceed recommendation; retains lower `rtc` behind
  a default-off feature after Chromium/Firefox and current Playwright WebKit
  verified-range success, exact current-host link/package measurements, and
  zero-owner cleanup. The apparent WebKit transport failure was an intermittent
  ICE run followed by a reproducible non-persistent OPFS test-sink failure;
  product UI, default enablement, TURN, public reachability, and deployment
  remained excluded from the spike.
- [`194-chromeos-android-extension-control.md`](194-chromeos-android-extension-control.md):
  complete; preserves the JSTorrent ChromeOS companion user journey while
  reversing its ownership. One Android foreground Rust application/engine/
  profile/SAF owner remains authoritative and the beta extension packages the
  shared React UI as an explicitly paired, detachable same-device
  presentation. It also makes the shared root action launch Android's SAF
  picker and retains earlier grants for torrents bound before a new root
  becomes current. Exact ARC permission/LNA, Host/Origin/auth, root-registry
  crash recovery, two-root lifecycle, Compose coexistence, detached transfer,
  reconnect, and same-LAN rejection pass. The listener binds only to ARC's
  fixed guest address and is refused through Chromebook Wi-Fi. Raw IO, legacy
  import, media, store publication, notifications, and network policy are
  excluded.
- [`193-stateless-foreground-downloader.md`](193-stateless-foreground-downloader.md):
  complete; adds one finite native downloader that composes the existing
  ephemeral in-memory-SQLite application service, writes directly to final
  paths, selects all files except an explicit magnet BEP 53 `so` selection,
  cooperatively locks one canonical output root, and keeps selective boundary
  bytes in an invocation-owned transient workspace. Controlled lifecycle and
  native macOS/Linux/Windows gates pass without durable resume, post-exit
  seeding, packaging, or a mobile CLI claim.
- [`192-production-owner-relay-access.md`](192-production-owner-relay-access.md):
  ready; turns the passing ephemeral OPAQUE/Wasm/dumb-relay proof into one
  local production-shaped desktop/configured-headless username/passphrase path
  with durable authority, automatic challenge-bound authorized-browser resume,
  complete authorization/circuit security audit, explicit recovery lifecycle,
  a release-built browser profile and a separate loopback-only relay service.
  Deployment and every supported-public-capability claim remain a later
  separately authorized tactical.
- [`191-direct-filesystem-storage.md`](191-direct-filesystem-storage.md):
  complete; removes hidden staging and publication machinery across storage,
  persistence, platform adapters, generated contracts, and UI, making direct
  libtorrent-shaped final paths the sole ordinary payload model with path,
  API 34 SAF, simulator/archive, and physical-iPhone evidence.
- [`190-opaque-wasm-relay-foundation.md`](190-opaque-wasm-relay-foundation.md):
  complete; proves an account-free username/passphrase OPAQUE flow through one
  native/Wasm Rust core and bounded dumb relay, carries the unchanged React
  application trace, rejects active/password/pin failures, records resource
  high waters, and authorizes no production remote access.
- [`189-library-playback-and-torrent-size.md`](189-library-playback-and-torrent-size.md):
  complete; connects eligible Library Media Play controls to the existing
  ephemeral browser/Tauri media capability and carries exact torrent total
  size through every first-party summary reducer and web size surface.
- [`188-existing-payload-adoption-and-recheck.md`](188-existing-payload-adoption-and-recheck.md):
  complete; replaces fresh-row destination collisions with automatic
  metainfo-exact discovery and the common complete checker, atomically fences
  discovered ownership behind a pending verification generation, and makes
  path/SAF removal preserve unrelated content.
- [`187-compact-metadata-acquisition-progress.md`](187-compact-metadata-acquisition-progress.md):
  complete; adds one selected-torrent packed BEP 9 block map for v1/v2/hybrid
  metadata plus a separate coarse BEP 52 integrity-preparation phase,
  generated first-party reducers, and accessible React General presentation.
- [`072-derived-media-catalog.md`](072-derived-media-catalog.md): complete; adds
  a pure deterministic video/episode classifier, one
  rebuildable application catalog, a separately leased media projection, and
  a responsive Library torrent detail with an explicit All files fallback.
  Thumbnails, artwork, playback presentation, persistence, and Library-wide
  media aggregation remain deferred.
- [`186-current-rates-and-incremental-speed-history.md`](186-current-rates-and-incremental-speed-history.md):
  complete; separates tiny latest-value current rates from interest-selected
  graph history, makes completed graph buckets exact cursor-validated
  coalescible appends, and cuts the preceding server-payload residual 41.98%
  without choosing a binary codec.
- [`176-durable-high-file-priority.md`](176-durable-high-file-priority.md):
  complete; carries durable High/Normal/Skip file priority through
  persistence, weighted ordinary scheduling, and all first-party clients,
  with final Xcode simulator and unsigned device-archive evidence.
- [`185-typed-sparse-hot-view-patches.md`](185-typed-sparse-hot-view-patches.md):
  complete; replaces measured repeated Torrent, File, Peer, and active-piece
  rows with closed typed field deltas across every first-party reducer and
  cuts another 36.77% from post-coalescing server payload while keeping
  semantics independent from a much later binary codec.
- [`184-view-aware-current-state-coalescing.md`](184-view-aware-current-state-coalescing.md):
  complete; coalesces compatible pending patches across interleaved logical

  contract change, reset, or lost state.
- [`183-production-websocket-ui-bandwidth-baseline.md`](183-production-websocket-ui-bandwidth-baseline.md):
  complete; adds bounded exact production React/WebSocket measurement and
  shows that interleaved same-view current-state updates defeat the intended
  coalescing before any delivery, row-shape, paging, or codec optimization.
- [`182-bounded-outbound-attempt-and-metadata-turnover.md`](182-bounded-outbound-attempt-and-metadata-turnover.md):
  complete; bounds preferred-uTP/TCP/MSE/plain handshake work to one 15-second
  outbound attempt and adds proven conservative one-at-a-time replacement of
  a zero-contribution worker only while the 30-peer metadata cohort is full.
- [`181-paced-metadata-connection-cohort.md`](181-paced-metadata-connection-cohort.md):
  completed expansion of the combined metadata dial/worker cohort to 30 with a

  separates exact source provenance from operational metadata, adds bounded
  v1 outer-metainfo and tracker-tier persistence, adopts libtorrent-aligned
  large-v1 parser/geometry limits with scalable storage and paged catalog
  owners, and carries one semantic byte-intake operation through WebSocket,
  HTTP automation, and raw Tauri IPC without adding visible picker UX or
  chunking.
- [`082-bounded-multi-peer-upload-ownership.md`](082-bounded-multi-peer-upload-ownership.md):
  completed; replaces the one-peer upload proof with shared connection
  budgets, eight fair seed upload slots, adaptive bounded reads/writes, and
  exact physical payload accounting. Simultaneous two-RSTorrent/two-libtorrent
  clients independently verified four complete copies while all declared
  limits and joined cleanup held.

  plus horizontal overflow on constrained widths.
- [`088-upnp-mapped-external-tcp-seeding.md`](088-upnp-mapped-external-tcp-seeding.md):
  complete; adds bounded IPv4 UPnP IGD v2 mapping ownership and proves exact

  generation-fenced advertised endpoint and retains discovery plus
  advertisement across the long-lived torrent runtime.
- [`093-bep6-fast-request-lifecycle.md`](093-bep6-fast-request-lifecycle.md):
  planned; implements the complete negotiated Fast request lifecycle,
  including explicit rejection, exactly-one terminal responses, initial
  availability forms, and bounded suggestions and allowed-fast state.
- [`094-bounded-bep11-peer-exchange.md`](094-bounded-bep11-peer-exchange.md):
  planned; adds a bounded general BEP 10 negotiation map and bidirectional PEX
  with exact live add/drop events, private gating, source diversity, hostile
  input limits, and controlled two-hop evidence.

  complete; makes Decimal `kB/MB/GB` the fresh and migrated browser default,
  retains persistent Binary `KiB/MiB/GiB` as an explicit choice, and updates
  every shared React byte/rate display without changing raw application data,
  sorting, chart geometry, or exact technical IEC copy.

  restartable, migrates the observed published-content contradiction without
  payload mutation, and contains torrent-local recovery failures during
  profile open.
- [`106-live-transfer-rate-tab-title.md`](106-live-transfer-rate-tab-title.md):
  complete; keeps the shared browser/Tauri tab title current with exact

- [`108-serialized-torrent-control-and-observable-checking.md`](108-serialized-torrent-control-and-observable-checking.md):
  complete; replaces whole-generation file-selection restart with serialized
  torrent reconciliation and a bounded storage fence, makes checking
  selection-independent, and exposes exact checker progress while retaining
  conservative validation and reserving a later trusting fast-resume option.
- [`109-stable-same-origin-web-launch.md`](109-stable-same-origin-web-launch.md):
  complete; gives the manual browser launcher one stable same-origin hosted
  gateway, removes caller-selected live destinations, and proves reconnect

  complete; adds MSE/PE for TCP peer connections in both directions through a
  sans-IO protocol state machine and one four-value live client policy, while
  claiming compatibility rather than security. Controlled interop/performance,
  Android cross-build, API 34 AVD, and API 37 physical Pixel 7a product
  evidence pass with exact publication, bounded resources, full owner drain,
  and cleanup.
- [`112-dual-stack-transport-and-ipv6-dht.md`](112-dual-stack-transport-and-ipv6-dht.md):
  complete and graduated; gives the session one
  coordinated TCP/UDP socket pair per address family, runs a BEP 32 IPv6 DHT
  node with its own BEP 42 identity and routing table beside the IPv4 node,
  makes the reachable peer port a per-family fact for BEP 7 announcing, and
  gates every IPv6 path behind one persisted `ipv6_enabled` setting defaulting
  to enabled. Claims no IPv6 incoming reachability.
- [`113-ipv6-firewall-pinhole-and-incoming-reachability.md`](113-ipv6-firewall-pinhole-and-incoming-reachability.md):
  closed, evidence-limited; bounded UPnP IGD v2
  `WANIPv6FirewallControl:1` pinhole control beside the existing IPv4 mapping
  under one reachability coordinator,
  distinguishes listener, unfiltered-gateway, installed-pinhole, and observed
  incoming evidence, and stages an off-LAN IPv6 peer hash-verifying proof.
  Protocol, coordinator/product, and physical-harness commits pass their
  deterministic, scripted, generated-contract, web, and Android gates. The live
  negative control passes, but the observed gateway returns typed `606` to
  `AddPinhole`. Positive physical capability is recorded as unknown on the
  current hardware; the tactical remains ungraduated and no control-transport
  expansion is implied. The pinned oracle implements no pinhole support, so
  every deterministic test is independently authored.

  complete session-wide concurrent download admission; schema 17 persists
  queue order and the default-three setting, one application owner admits exact

  complete prerequisite storage shoring; path and supported Android SAF now
  share observations, root health, published reads, explicit namespace
  transitions, and one dynamic product architecture. Full AVD/physical
  Android matrices and a bounded physical-iPhone storage, networking, and
  lifecycle feasibility harness pass without adding fast resume or an iOS
  product claim.
- [`117-jstorrent-shaped-android-product-ui.md`](117-jstorrent-shaped-android-product-ui.md):
  complete Android product-presentation slice; replaces the bootstrap page
  with a fully connected JSTorrent-shaped Compose library, six-tab detail,

  loopback interoperability tactical in both roles.
- [`126-controlled-outbound-utp-wan-evidence.md`](126-controlled-outbound-utp-wan-evidence.md):
  closed evidence-limited after its authorized read-only `pimom` preflight
  found only LAN and Tailscale/shared-range IPv4 addresses and no installed
  libtorrent oracle. No fixture, listener, uTP packet, package, network change,
  or WAN interoperability claim followed.
- [`127-mapped-utp-wan-interoperability.md`](127-mapped-utp-wan-interoperability.md):
  complete mapped-WAN uTP slice; establishes the pinned oracle on `pimom` and
  proves one exact RSTorrent-leecher transfer through a finite remote UDP UPnP
  lease over the direct public path rather than Tailscale. Exact deletion and
  independent post-run audits prove zero mapping, process, and artifact
  residue. The local-mapping fallback was not needed, and product uTP stays
  disabled at the required human-review checkpoint.
- [`128-controlled-tcp-performance-diagnosis.md`](128-controlled-tcp-performance-diagnosis.md):
  complete deterministic TCP-only comparison of focused RSTorrent, resumable

- [`141-product-wan-tcp-utp-comparison.md`](141-product-wan-tcp-utp-comparison.md):
  closed evidence-limited; the reporter-fixed physical budget retained one
  exact 8 MiB uTP case at 0.096759 MiB/s active, but duplicate remote TCP peer
  entries and one premature completion-milestone check left zero complete
  pairs. Every attempt cleaned exactly; the repaired single-connection oracle
  has no further WAN authorization in this tactical.
- [`142-wan-transport-performance-matrix.md`](142-wan-transport-performance-matrix.md):
  complete through child Tacticals `145` and `150`; its reusable cross-engine,

  complete second iOS slice; directly reuses the first-party
  JSTorrent SwiftUI views, assets, and localizations over typed RSTorrent
  models while deferring Search and unsupported High priority.

  completion, Apple Files playback, and exact cleanup pass.
- [`153-wired-lan-utp-data-plane-scalability.md`](153-wired-lan-utp-data-plane-scalability.md):
  decision-complete and Later; measures RSTorrent TCP/uTP and pinned-
  libtorrent throughput over a wired gigabit-effective Mac-to-Linux/Windows
  LAN, attributes packet-rate ceilings, and records native Windows separately
  without claiming 2.5 GbE through the Mac's 1 GbE adapter.
- [`154-ios-truthful-progress-and-system-preview.md`](154-ios-truthful-progress-and-system-preview.md):
  complete; reserves iOS 100%/Finished for canonical complete-and-published
  state and opens available files directly in Apple's Quick Look/video
  presentation under the existing scoped lease, with real-swarm playback and
  exact cleanup proven on physical hardware.
- [`155-v2-magnet-authenticated-hash-exchange.md`](155-v2-magnet-authenticated-hash-exchange.md):
  complete; adds strict `btmh` intake/export, SHA-256 BEP 9 metadata, volatile
  authenticated sparse hash knowledge, messages 21--23, hash-first payload,
  conservative restart, leaf corruption repair, hash upload, controlled
  two-role pinned-libtorrent interoperability, and proportional web, Tauri,
  Android, and iOS evidence while hybrid and creation remain deferred.
- [`156-hybrid-dual-swarm-runtime-closure.md`](156-hybrid-dual-swarm-runtime-closure.md):
  complete; implements strict hybrid source/magnet intake, first-owner
  provisional reconciliation, one owner across v1/v2 discovery and peer lanes,
  mandatory dual integrity, BEP 47 padding, restart/seeding, both-swarm/both-
  role pinned-libtorrent evidence, and first-party platforms while creation and
  single-format fallback remain deferred.
- [`157-beta-release-foundation.md`](157-beta-release-foundation.md): complete;
  establishes the beta-readiness ledger, graduates the complete
  Android client to its durable module path, adds provisional packaging
  art/metadata, and reconciles status before signed updater and cross-platform
  CI slices.
- [`158-desktop-signed-packaging-and-updater.md`](158-desktop-signed-packaging-and-updater.md):
  active release work; its Tauri-only
  `desktop-update-v1` UI/state boundary, per-app identity/key/route, hosted
  signed five-target package rehearsal, public `desktop-v0.1.0` through
  `desktop-v0.1.2` finalization, one installed macOS arm64 launch smoke, and
  exact macOS arm64 plus Linux arm64 `0.1.0`-to-`0.1.1` replacement/relaunch
  pass. Windows x86_64 replacement also passes under an automatic-loopback
  profile. Public `0.1.2` carries the completed Tacticals `160`--`166` repairs
  and integrations; its full signed matrix and bounded macOS arm64
  launch/native-host spot check pass. Clean Windows update/firewall-consent
  characterization and Linux x86_64 remain open; installed Intel macOS testing
  is a deliberate omission.
- [`159-cross-platform-presubmit-ci.md`](159-cross-platform-presubmit-ci.md):
  complete; installs credential-free Rust, web, deterministic browser E2E,
  native desktop, Android, iOS, and short controlled-interoperability checks
  proven across the hosted matrix.
- [`162-desktop-single-instance-and-tray-lifecycle.md`](162-desktop-single-instance-and-tray-lifecycle.md):
  complete; adds one packaged desktop lifetime, default-on close-to-tray
  behavior, persisted background policy, visible tray updater action, joined
  Quit/restart shutdown, native Linux arm64 packaging, release-only Windows
  GUI launch, and installed Windows x86_64/Linux arm64 lifecycle evidence.
- [`163-desktop-external-torrent-intake.md`](163-desktop-external-torrent-intake.md):
  complete; registers `magnet:` and local `.torrent` activation, routes cold
  and warm input through the existing single owner and Add-options flow, and
  passes installed Linux arm64, Windows x86_64-application, macOS arm64, and
  exact hosted eight-job acceptance.
- [`164-desktop-completion-and-attention-notifications.md`](164-desktop-completion-and-attention-notifications.md):
  complete; adds edge-triggered, non-replaying native desktop completion and
  fatal/repair notifications, typed Tauri-only preferences, Linux click
  restoration, joined cleanup, and installed macOS/Windows/Linux evidence.
- [`165-cross-platform-active-download-sleep-inhibition.md`](165-cross-platform-active-download-sleep-inhibition.md):
  complete; adds default-on desktop/Android active-work sleep inhibition,
  removes Android's Wi-Fi lock, records iOS inapplicability, and passes
  guest-native macOS/Windows/Linux plus physical Android/iOS evidence with
  exact inhibitor and artifact cleanup.

  complete; adds the bounded RSTorrent
  desktop native compatibility/launch host, per-user registration and sidecar
  packaging, and a self-contained Manifest V3 JSTorrent Beta seed ZIP. Its
  draft identity, public key, and exact origin are pinned; real Chrome 151 on
  an installed unsigned macOS arm64 app proves native `hello` from a stopped
  state and cold desktop launch.
- [`167-chromeos-crostini-bundled-web-launcher.md`](167-chromeos-crostini-bundled-web-launcher.md):
  complete; packages the Rust gateway and mature React UI together in ChromeOS
  Linux, adds one static on-demand user service and mapped Launcher handoff
  through the exact beta extension, and passes the available physical
  Chromebook lifecycle, transfer-detachment, preservation, and purge matrix.
  Full reboot remains conditional because the testbed has no approved profile
  login credential.
- [`168-platform-aware-extension-launcher.md`](168-platform-aware-extension-launcher.md):
  complete; makes the beta popup platform-relevant, with desktop native
  bootstrap only on desktop and the exact published JSTorrent Android listing
  plus ChromeOS Linux controls on ChromeOS. The reviewed `0.3.0` package and
  physical chooser/link/handoff spot check pass without claiming Play or app
  availability.
- [`169-hosted-crostini-bootstrap-and-release.md`](169-hosted-crostini-bootstrap-and-release.md):
  complete; adds a pinned-key signed-manifest one-command Crostini installer,
  separate native x86_64/ARM64 release workflow, and physical signed-fixture
  evidence. A later explicitly authorized operation published non-latest
  `crostini-v0.1.0`, deployed the website bootstrap, and passed exact public
  x86_64 install/Launcher/relaunch acceptance.

  complete; packages one ordinary-user Linux application owner and exact React
  assets, adds strict durable root/listener/origin/Basic secret-file
  configuration and explicit systemd user enablement, and proves private
  HTTPS/WSS-proxy control plus zero-view transfer/re-seeding, idle availability,
  joined restart, rollback-safe repair, uninstall preservation, and exact real
  x86_64 Linux cleanup. x86_64/ARM64 construction passes without claiming
  native ARM64 systemd, built-in TLS, relay, or a public release.
- [`171-signed-headless-release-and-lan-service.md`](171-signed-headless-release-and-lan-service.md):
  complete; adds a strict signed two-architecture headless
  release/update lane, operator-approved CLI and browser update discovery,
  one exact RFC 1918 unauthenticated full-owner mode with truthful UI, and an
  enabled healthy current-host x86_64 service at its exact LAN authority.
  Public publication, unattended replacement, system-wide ownership, firewall
  changes, and Raspberry Pi mutation remain explicitly absent; Tactical `158`
  remains independently active.
- [`172-provisional-magnet-display-name.md`](172-provisional-magnet-display-name.md):
  complete; carries bounded magnet `dn` as a distinct provisional source
  label through current-schema restart and first-party torrent-list
  presentation, with verified metainfo retaining authority.
- [`173-mobile-web-table-horizontal-scrolling.md`](173-mobile-web-table-horizontal-scrolling.md):
  complete; makes configured-visible columns authoritative at every width,
  restores trusted two-axis touch scrolling with directional continuation
  affordances, and proves the complete Swarm defaults at 390- and 456-pixel
  phone widths without changing virtual row bounds or table interaction.
- [`174-exact-tailnet-headless-access.md`](174-exact-tailnet-headless-access.md):
  complete; adds bounded explicit multi-endpoint hosting for the existing
  direct LAN authority plus one exact loopback Tailscale Serve HTTPS authority,
  retains one application owner and endpoint-correct media URLs, and proves
  the installed LAN/tailnet service without wildcard, Funnel, or ACL changes.
- [`175-retained-swarm-peer-transfer-totals.md`](175-retained-swarm-peer-transfer-totals.md):
  complete; adds exact useful payload download/upload contribution to every
  retained Swarm record across active connections, backoff, disconnect, and
  reconnect, carries canonical decimal strings through generated web/UniFFI
  boundaries, and proves the installed LAN/tailnet service without changing
  peer policy or adding durable history. Tactical `158` remains independently
  active.

Tactical `015` completed the oracle campaign's headless measurement
foundation. Current prioritization and the compaction-safe restart
checkpoint live in [`../topics/capability-readiness.md`](../topics/capability-readiness.md)
and [`../topics/oracle-driven-engine-campaign.md`](../topics/oracle-driven-engine-campaign.md).
