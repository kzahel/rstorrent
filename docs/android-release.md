# Android Release Runbook

Android release now targets the existing JSTorrent `com.jstorrent.app` app,
starting with source candidate 1.0.25/versionCode 25 and `android-vX.Y.Z` tags.
Debug builds retain `org.rstorrent.bootstrap`; Kotlin/JNI namespace stays
unchanged. A release-only alias preserves the legacy launcher component.
The Android Release workflow builds both arm64-v8a and x86_64, runs release
JVM tests and lint, and verifies signed APK/AAB artifacts before publication.
Google Play upload and rollout remain manual.

Tactical [250](tactical/250-jstorrent-production-identity-candidates.md) prepares
this lane but has not provisioned private signing material, built a candidate
with the production key, submitted to Play or published an update. Follow the
[full cutover checklist](jstorrent-cutover-checklist.md) before any delivery.
Check maximum versionCode in every Play track; code 25 exceeds only the pinned
released 1.0.24 baseline. Minimum API 28 (Android 9) is selected on 2026-10-01.
API 26/27 are outside the replacement cohort; those devices keep the old app
until an OS update permits replacement. Validate unsupported-device guidance.

The former independent canary's first verified release is
[Android 0.1.0](https://github.com/kzahel/rstorrent/releases/tag/android-v0.1.0)
(versionCode 1). Its
[tagged workflow](https://github.com/kzahel/rstorrent/actions/runs/34039237324)
passed build, signature/packaging validation, and prerelease publication.

## Release A Version

Only after explicit release authorization, add a nonempty `## [1.0.26]`
section to `clients/android/CHANGELOG.md` and commit it first. From a clean `main` checkout:

```sh
scripts/release-android.sh 1.0.26 --dry-run
scripts/release-android.sh 1.0.26
```

The helper validates the version and changelog, increments Gradle's integer
`versionCode`, sets `versionName`, commits the version change, creates an
annotated tag, and atomically pushes main and the tag. Each release version
must increase; the version code is never derived from CI run numbers. If a
push fails, the local commit/tag remain available for inspection and retry;
do not run the bump helper again blindly.

The tag workflow checks that the tag matches the checked-in version, builds
signed artifacts, then creates a GitHub **prerelease** with:

- `jstorrent-android-X.Y.Z.aab` for Play Console;
- `jstorrent-android-X.Y.Z.apk` for direct installation; and
- `SHA256SUMS` for exact artifact hashes.

Android releases do not take over the repository's desktop latest release.
Publication refuses to overwrite an existing release. Failed builds never
reach the publication job. Minification remains disabled for these candidates;
no mapping file is implied or fabricated.

## Build Without A Tag

Use Actions → Android Release → Run workflow, or:

```sh
gh workflow run android-release.yml --ref main
```

The same signed checks run, but results are retained as an Actions artifact
for 14 days and no GitHub release is created. Download the ZIP from the
completed workflow run's Artifacts section. It contains the AAB and APK.
Artifacts in a public repository are not private; signing keys are never
included in them.

For a **manual diagnostic build only**, the workflow's
`existing_signing_rehearsal=true` option tries the existing canary inputs. Final
validation still requires the original JSTorrent certificate. A mismatch is a
failure, and any retained APK/AAB is explicitly unqualified; it cannot replace
an old installation or establish Play continuity. This option cannot apply to
tagged publication. No Play upload is automatic.

## Signing And Backup

The workflow now requires dedicated original JSTorrent secrets:

- `JSTORRENT_ANDROID_UPLOAD_KEYSTORE_BASE64`
- `JSTORRENT_ANDROID_UPLOAD_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
- `JSTORRENT_ANDROID_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS`
- `JSTORRENT_ANDROID_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD`

They are required inputs, **not configured/verified by Tactical 250**. Do not
reuse the former `ANDROID_UPLOAD_*` canary secrets. Provision the original key
through an authorized secure handoff and verify its certificate. CI decodes it
into its temporary directory and removes it on normal exit/failure. Local builds
consume `UPLOAD_KEYSTORE_PATH`, `UPLOAD_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS`
and `UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD`. Keep keystore/password backups outside Git, with
restricted permissions; never print their values in diagnostics.

`clients/android/upload-certificate.pem` is public and now pins the verified
GitHub-released JSTorrent 1.0.24 APK signer:
`ccb5af8e44d626e9aefb1f0fbd8496dbf23ad27da9347248e71fb3ce70044915`.
The provenance/hash is in `distribution/jstorrent-production.json`.
`incubation-upload-certificate.pem` retains the former independent canary root.
Final APK/AAB validation refuses that old key and debug keys.

Confirm that the existing Play app accepts this upload certificate. Record its
**app-signing certificate separately**. Play may use a different distribution
key, so a GitHub-signed APK does not prove it can replace an installed Play APK.
Do not create a new Play app or enroll new app signing as part of replacement.
An intentional upload-key rotation needs a separate enrollment/backup/secrets
and expected-certificate change.

For a local signed build, load the backup's `signing.env`, then:

```sh
source ~/.profile
source /path/to/android-signing/signing.env
clients/android/build.sh release
```

Missing signing variables fail before building. There is no debug-key
fallback. Google Play App Signing manages the distribution signing key;
the upload key authenticates uploaded bundles. A directly installed APK may
therefore have a different signing identity from the Play-installed app.

## Upload To Play

Select the **existing JSTorrent (`com.jstorrent.app`)** app. After signing,
version and cutover gates pass and upload is explicitly authorized, upload the
AAB to an appropriate internal/testing track. Install Play-generated artifacts
over selected existing Play builds without uninstall/data clear. Check migrated
torrents/settings, real SAF access, background behavior and staggered extension
updates before promotion. Store form completion or a disposable-signature
emulator rehearsal cannot satisfy signed installed delivery qualification.

## Toolchain And Verification

Java 17, Gradle 8.11.1, AGP 8.10.1, SDK 36, build-tools 35.0.0,
NDK 28.2.13676358, Rust 1.97.0, and cargo-ndk 4.1.2 are pinned.
AGP 8.10 supports API 36 with this existing Gradle version:
https://developer.android.com/build/releases/agp-8-10-0-release-notes

The workflow checksum-pins bundletool 1.18.3. Validation checks the package,
versions, SDK, retained single legacy launcher alias, non-debuggable manifest,
absence of diagnostic receivers,
upload certificate and signatures, matching native libraries in both
artifacts, both supported ABIs, ELF segment alignment, APK ZIP alignment,
and AAB 16 KiB alignment configuration. These are packaging checks, not a
claim of runtime qualification on a 16 KiB device.

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_*android*.py'
scripts/release-android.sh --check --tag android-v1.0.25
python3 scripts/validate-android-release.py --bundletool /path/to/bundletool.jar
```

Update the example tag to the current version. Google documents native
alignment requirements at https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes.


## Dependency Attribution

Install `cargo install cargo-about --locked --version 0.9.2 --features cli` alongside the
existing Android toolchain. Gradle generates variant-specific notice assets
before packaging. Release construction includes its 79 resolved Maven
artifacts and the union of both Android Rust targets; debug includes four
additional tooling artifacts. These counts are evidence for the current
graph, not hard-coded limits. The manifest records original artifact/POM
hashes and source locators, inherited grants, original embedded notices and
reviewed JNA/graphics native supplements. New native AARs or changed reviewed
archives fail generation.

`inspect-android-notices.py` checks a debug APK without signing credentials.
The signed release validator requires notice integrity and the expected
native-library attribution inventory in both APK and AAB outputs. A changed
or missing notice, wrong variant or extra native library fails the gate.
Do not treat the presence of this bundle as blanket legal clearance or a
corresponding-source offer.
