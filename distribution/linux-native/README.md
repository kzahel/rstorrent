# Linux AppImage native library builds

First-party JSTorrent remains MIT. This recipe removes two reviewed GPL-only
runtime library chains from Linux AppImages while retaining the GTK3 tray and
WebKit UI. This is bounded packaging work, not a new Linux compatibility promise
or comprehensive license/security clearance. Linux remains best effort.

`sources.json` binds the exact Ubuntu descriptors, upstream archives and Debian
changes by size and SHA-256. Verify all files before extraction. `dpkg-source`
applies the original Debian patches, including TIFF's sixteen fixes through
CVE-2025-61144. Descriptor signatures are retained; independent OpenPGP
authentication is not claimed. Review security updates before changing pins.

The small, independently authored appindicator patch adds an upstream-default
enabled desktop-shortcut option. Our GTK3 build disables it, excluding the
libayatana-indicator header and dependency. The ordinary menu, icon, status and
fallback behavior are unchanged. The exported `app_indicator_build_menu_from_desktop`
remains callable, logs a warning and leaves the ordinary menu intact. JSTorrent's
tray uses `app_indicator_set_menu`; it does not use desktop-file shortcuts.
The patch retains the original library's LGPL2.1/LGPL3 alternatives and all
original copyrights. Source tools/tests may contain GPL code; they are not
bundled executable runtime components.

TIFF's supported `-Djbig=OFF` option removes JBIG. Other reviewed codecs and
symbol versioning remain enabled. JBIG-compressed TIFF images are unsupported;
this does not affect torrent data transfer.

Build in a fresh Ubuntu24.04 x64 or ARM64 environment with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake pkg-config dpkg-dev patch \
  libgtk-3-dev libdbusmenu-gtk3-dev libgirepository1.0-dev libjpeg-dev \
  liblzma-dev libzstd-dev libwebp-dev zlib1g-dev libdeflate-dev liblerc-dev
python3 scripts/build-linux-native.py --sources-dir /owned/sources \
  --output /owned/native-build --download
```

The output root must not exist. The script never installs into `/usr`; it emits
`prefix/lib/`, `source-materials/` and `provenance.json`. Sources may instead be
provided offline by omitting `--download`. Preserve all materials and notices.
The compiler, flags, patch series, recipe/input/output hashes and architecture
are recorded. Source archives and the custom build recipe travel inside the
AppImage's native notice bundle. Remaining third-party libraries retain their
own licenses and corresponding-source obligations.

Set `JSTORRENT_LINUX_NATIVE_BUILD` to this output root for Tauri packaging.
The output hook replaces both regular SONAME copies before native attribution,
checks that no other consumer still needs the two GPL-only library families,
then removes their unused copies. Unknown consumers, recipe/input drift,
wrong-architecture builds or missing provenance fail packaging before signing.
Custom binaries are attributed as source builds, not unchanged distro files.
`inspect-distribution.py --require-native-notices --require-mit-native` repeats
the source/material and known dependency checks after extraction.

`verify-linux-native.py` compares all exported symbols against retained original
libraries, resolves relocations, checks TIFF codecs and loads the original
GdkPixbuf TIFF module. TIFF's upstream CTest suite runs during building.
`tray-probe.c` independently checks ordinary GTK menu callbacks and indicator
state under an owned `dbus-run-session -- xvfb-run` test session. It is test
source only; its executable is never part of the AppImage.

Original signed packages remain unchanged historical evidence. A rebuilt
AppImage requires a new signed candidate and package/runtime qualification.
